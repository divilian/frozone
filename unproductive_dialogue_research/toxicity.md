# Toxicity

## Definition
Toxicity refers to hostile or demeaning language that undermines respectful discourse by targeting individuals or groups with insults, threats, harassment, or ridicule.


## Response Options

Apologies in advance, only found studies to support a few of these, so the others seem speculative.

### 1. Empathetic / Prosocial Replies

Active listening and validation: acknowledge the person’s frustration or emotion without endorsing the toxic phrasing.

Example: “I can see this topic feels really important to you. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel that way?”

[In one study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2116310118?utm_source=chatgpt.com), empathy-based counterspeech was found to reduce toxicity among twitter users and increase likelihood of constructive continuation.

One counterpoint: could the effectiveness of this depend on the intent of the toxic individual? If they are intentionally trolling, maybe a response like this will make them laugh and keep going. Perhaps this could also come off as validating to toxicity? However, if the speaker was well-intentioned and got carried away, something like this seems much more likely to work.

### 2. Norm‐setting Interventions

Polite reminders of community standards with gentle cues.

Example: “Let’s try to keep this respectful so we can all have a good conversation.” 

Norm cues may work better than direct confrontation because they depersonalize the correction. 

[In one study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1813486116?utm_source=chatgpt.com), a bot posting the rules while openly acknowledging it was a bot significantly increased rule-following, which implicity includes rules about toxicity.

Some counterpoints: similar to the first response option, this would seem less effective with intentional trolling. However, a counterargument to this is that the statement of the rules may make even a troll turn it down simply for fear that they will be banned should their behavior continue, and be able to troll no more. Effectiveness may also depend on the position of the counterspeaker / the counterspeaker's ability to enforce rules.

### 3. Reframing and Topic Shifting

Reframing toxic content into neutral or solution-focused language.

Example: “Instead of calling them idiots, maybe what you mean is you disagree with their policy on healthcare?”

Essentially, moving the speaker away from personalized attacks to the substantive issue.

One counterpoint: the wording of the example here feels condescending; it may only really work if the bot is a moderator, as then, it looks like the bot is trying to give a charitable reading to the offender's actions, which may curry favor. But perhaps this can be done less condescendingly in general, which could make this really effective.

### 4. Humor & Light Deflection

Studies suggest well‐placed humor can diffuse tension, provided it doesn’t belittle the speaker.

Example: Two participants are throwing hostile comments back and forth, calling each other names. Bot response: "Woah, sounds like we’ve got a heavyweight championship going on here — but sadly, no prize belts are available in this chat. How about we go back to the main event: actually talking like humans again?"

[In one study](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2998181.2998277), Twitch users were found to mimic behavior of other users; in this way, humor could be a useful de-escalator.

Could work well especially in diffusing a situation like the above, where two people just get carried away.

### 5. Perspective‐Taking Prompts

Inviting users to reflect on consequences. This is similar to and may even fall under 1. 

Example: “How do you think the person you’re replying to will feel reading that?”

This draws from empathy-building and restorative practices.

The counterpoint to this would be the same as the counterpoint to 1.: it doesn't seem to work well against trolls.

### 6. Restorative / Relational Repair

Encouraging acknowledgment and rephrasing. This is similar to and may even fall under 3.

Example: “Would you like to restate that in a way that gets your point across without putting the other person down?”

Promotes responsibility without shaming.

The counterpoint to this would be the same as the counterpoint against 3.: it needs to be done in a way which is not condescending.

### 7. Silence or Non‐Engagement

Sometimes the best de‐escalation is no immediate response at all. Strategic non-response can prevent fueling the cycle while allowing moderation tools (timeouts, filtering) to work in the background.

Especially if they're trolling, ignoring it and proceeding with the conversation as if they hadn't said anything could be best.

### Some follow-up topics
- Trolling versus genuine toxicity: can we detect the difference, and should responses differ? Perhaps the bot could even build user profiles to determine genuity versus trolling.
- More sourcing to back which approaches are most effective, or if different situations should get different approaches.
