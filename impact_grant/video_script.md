# Script for Impact Grant video

## Their instructions

Pitch video (1-3 minutes), passionately making the case for funding the initiative and explaining its impact in more detail; the video should be simple—no need for high production value or heavy editing.

## Our script

### Stephen (55 secs)

Hi! I'm Stephen Davies, a professor in the UMW Computer Science department and
the first program director for the university's Data Science program. I'm here
with Bethanie Hackett, Laur Rider, and Garrett McKenzie, three amazing computer
science students who're working with me on a research project we call **Project
Frozone**. (If you've seen _The Incredibles_, you may remember Frozone as the
superhero who can shoot ice out of his hands, kind of like Elsa in Frozen.)

Our project's goal is to develop ways to improve the quality of online
political speech, and to see if we can mitigate some of the entrenched
polarization that's so common in our society lately. To do so, we're using
Large Language Model, or ``LLM,'' technology, which I'm sure you're familiar
with in tools like ChatGPT. We're seeking to train an LLM to participate in an
online political chat as though it were a regular human user, but with the goal
of improving the effectiveness of that dialogue -- ``cooling down the
temperature,'' so to speak; hence the project name ``Frozone.''

### Bethanie (30 secs)

One of our tasks is to ``fine-tune'' a language model by showing it samples of
actual online political discussions, together with examples of
``counterspeech,'' or ways it might respond that would improve the dialogue.
We're training our language model to detect instances of misinformation, toxic
speech, bias, logical fallacies, and other unproductive elements of a
conversation, and to respond to them in a way that promotes truth, compromise,
and respect for other opinions. We named our LLM ``Frobot'' since, like the
hero Frozone, it's designed to make political conversations less heated and
more fruitful.

### Laur (30 secs)

To evaluate what kind of impact Frobot might have on political conversations,
we're going to perform two studies. In one of them, we'll have human
participants engage in a chat room experiment with Frobot and two other bots
which are designed simply to mimic mainstream social media content. We'll
analyze the chat logs from this experiment, as well as surveys that
participants complete in which they comment on what they thought about Frobot's
contributions to the discussion. In the other, we'll simulate a social media
platform at a larger scale, using a technique called Agent-Based Modeling. This
will help us understand how the political polarization of a society as a whole
might be affected by deploying Frobots in various quantities.

### Garrett (30 secs)

Training the Frobot, and executing the agent-based model, will be expensive,
which is why we're asking you for funding. We'll be using the Google Gemini
suite of language modeling tools to fine-tune the Frobot on large quantities of
social media text. This will also require a considerable amount of cloud-based
storage. Additionally, we'll be using the Google Cloud infrastructure both to
host our chatroom experiment and also to carry out computationally-intensive
simulations on the agent-based model. The computing and storage resources
required for all this are significant, as the budget we're submitting with this
request makes clear.

### Stephen (15 secs)

Thanks for considering us along with the many other proposals you're receiving
for your generous funding. We believe that safeguarding our democracy and
strengthening trust are among the most important things we can do for our
society right now, and we hope that project Frozone can contribute to upholding
the values we all hold dear. Thanks for your time!
