## Noah's Highlight Reel Gemini Comparison

Below is a comparison of Gemini Frobot's performance in each scenario as compared to the original ChatGPT-based version:

### Highlight Reel

#### Picking up on subtleties - it does a decent job

Roughly the same performance:

A: I hate President Trump

(pass)

B: I really hate him as well. 

(pass)

C: It's gonna be such a great day... 

(pass)

D: What's gonna be such a great day?

(pass)

C: Well, you know, he's nearly 80, and we're all in our 20s. We'll definitely be around for it

F: C, I understand there can be strong feelings about political figures, but comments that seem to imply or celebrate someone's potential demise aren't really appropriate for a constructive discussion. Let's try to keep our conversations focused on policies and ideas, rather than personal well-being.

#### (No longer!) Too self-righteous, and fixating on the wrong things

The Gemini version did much better here; less argumentative:

A: What are the group's thoughts on the legal status of pornography?

(pass)

B: It's degrading to women, I think it should be illegal.

(pass)

C: Disagree. If the chicks wanna show off their bodies, let them ;)

F: C, I'd suggest we try to use more respectful language when talking about people, especially women. Referring to them as "chicks" can come across as pretty dismissive and objectifying.

C: Nah F shutup

F: C, I understand you might disagree with my point, but asking someone to "shutup" isn't a constructive way to communicate. Let's try to keep the conversation respectful and avoid personal attacks.
