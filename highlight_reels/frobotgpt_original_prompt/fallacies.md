# Logical Fallacies ChatGPT FroBot Highlight Reel

## Positives (What It Does Well):
- Detects all logical fallacies present (i.e. no false negatives)
- The response it gives has good information and explanation of why the statement is a fallacy
  - However, the response does need some tweaking to address the issues below (namely, a condescending tone and an excess of information that makes it relatively clear that FroBot is indeed a bot.
- Sometimes, FroBot does identify what I think would be a logical fallacy as just bias; but it still responds in a good way, so this may not be an issue for us 

## Negativies (Issues with It Currently):

### Slightly condescending tone/speaking with an assumed authority (that would likely be off-putting to participants)
C: I agree with A. Asylum seekers is a dumb and useless protection. It harms America only. Screw all those other countries.

D: Woah C, you're sounding really stupid right now. What you're saying is just stupid. You're just a racist, stupid, idiotic piece of shit. You have no compassion at all

F: D, I understand you’re upset — that kind of comment from C can definitely be frustrating. But calling someone names and using insults doesn’t help move the discussion forward. It’s better if we focus on the ideas rather than the person. Maybe we can talk about why asylum protections exist and how they could be improved instead of attacking each other. 

### Sounding like a bot (lot of specific information a regular person wouldn't know off-hand; citing sources frequently)
C: I really agree with what Donald Trump is doing regarding immigration. This country needs someone who's going to take a strong stance like him.

B: Honestly, I don’t agree at all. Trump’s immigration policies were super harsh and caused a lot of unnecessary pain for families. I think we can have strong borders and treat people with humanity at the same time.

A: Families wouldn’t be split up if people just came here the right way to begin with. Trump was just enforcing the laws that were already there — finally someone had the guts to do it.

C: Yes exactly! People just break the rules and then want to act all innocent and get upset when they have to face the consequences. 

F: I get where you’re coming from, C — people should follow the law. But it’s worth remembering that many of those families separated at the border were actually asylum seekers, which means they were legally allowed to request protection under U.S. and international law. The “zero tolerance” policy in 2018 went beyond existing law and led to thousands of children being separated from their parents. Here’s a reliable summary from the American Immigration Council that explains it clearly: https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/family-separation-policy.

A: I don’t know, F. A lot of these so-called “asylum seekers” were just taking advantage of the system. We’ve got enough problems here at home — veterans, homeless folks, jobs going overseas. We can’t just let everyone in and hope it works out. 

F: That’s a fair concern, A — we definitely need to take care of people here at home. But it’s not quite accurate to say most asylum seekers are abusing the system. The majority of them are fleeing real dangers like violence or political persecution, and U.S. law specifically allows people to apply for asylum even if they entered the country without documentation. According to the Migration Policy Institute, asylum claims undergo strict vetting, and only those who meet legal standards are approved. You can read more about how that process works here: https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/us-asylum-system-overview. 

### FroBot not responding when being called out
This issue is not specific to the logical fallacies aspect, but I'm including it here because it is still an issue that needs to be addressed

A: F, you're just wrong. How hard it is to recognize that? 

(pass)

### Calling out fallacies that are unrelated to the main argument and/or are clearly sarcastic/a joke
A: Donald Trump's presidency has been a moderate success. He has only gotten one major Congressional bill passed, but it did contain provisions across several sectors. The bill enacted several tax reforms and cut Medicaid spending - all things I personally agree with. I guess all multi-part bills are better than single issue ones! 

F: (logical fallacy) A, saying that all multi-part bills are better than single-issue ones is an overgeneralization. A bill’s quality depends on its content, not how many issues it covers. Some multi-part bills can include unrelated or poorly designed provisions, while single-issue bills can be very effective when focused on solving a clear, specific problem. It’s better to evaluate each bill based on its goals and outcomes rather than its size or scope.

----
B: Biden's economic policies are much worse than Obama's economic policies were. Even though they are both Democrats, Obama was a much better president. I guess white people just aren't cut out for being president, lol. 

F: (toxic language and bias) B, that comment is offensive and unfair. Judging someone’s ability to lead based on their race is discrimination, and it doesn’t reflect reality or the principles of equal opportunity. Criticizing or comparing presidents on their policies is fine — that’s healthy debate — but bringing race into it isn’t relevant or respectful. Let’s keep the focus on their decisions and results rather than who they are personally.

C: The Republican party's main problem is that they don't adequately engage in outreach to the younger generations. Most young people vote Democrat, not Republican. The Republican party is going to lose elections if they don't correct their outreach problem and expand their voting base. Young people aren't going to be swayed from the Democratic party without a sufficient outreach program from the other side. All young people are super stubborn anyways! 

F: (bias) C, your overall point about political outreach is reasonable, but the line “all young people are super stubborn” is a stereotype. Young voters are a diverse group with a range of opinions, priorities, and levels of political engagement. Some are quite open-minded and even switch parties or positions over time. It might be more accurate to say that many young voters are firm in their beliefs right now — but even that can change as outreach and circumstances evolve.
