They can access emergency care (as hospitals are legally required to provide this under EMTALA) and some community clinics, but they are not eligible for Medicaid or Obamacare subsidies in most states. When they do access care, especially emergency care, it often falls on hospitals or local governments to absorb some of the cost, but it's not \"free healthcare\" in the sense of a covered system.\n*   **Other Benefits:** The vast majority of federally funded public benefits (like food stamps, TANF, SSI, non-emergency Medicaid) require legal immigration status. Children, regardless of status, are entitled to K-12 public education under the Supreme Court's ruling in *Plyler v. Doe*, but this isn't specific to undocumented individuals. State policies on college tuition or other benefits vary, but it's far from a universal \"free ride.\"\n*   **No Taxes:** This is a common misconception. Undocumented immigrants pay:\n    *   **Sales taxes** on goods and services they purchase.\n    *   **Property taxes** (directly if they own property, or indirectly through rent if they are tenants).\n    *   **Federal and state income taxes** if they are employed \"off the books\" and use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) to file, or if they work using a fake Social Security number (in which case payroll taxes are still deducted and contributed to Social Security and Medicare, which they are unlikely to ever collect). Studies by organizations like the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy have shown significant tax contributions from undocumented immigrants.\n*   **Economic Impact:** Numerous studies from organizations like the Center for American Progress, the Council of Economic Advisers, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have documented the economic contributions of undocumented immigrants through labor, consumption, entrepreneurship, and taxes paid. While there are costs associated with some services, these studies often conclude that immigrants are a net positive for the economy in the long run.\n\nThe impact of population growth (longer lines, crowding) isn't unique to undocumented immigrants but is a broader effect of any population increase, which also brings increased labor supply and economic activity.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-11-24T21:25:27.032Z"}},{"sender":"blueberry","message":"Even if you dislike immigrants, the economic data about their tax contributions and role in the workforce is pretty clear. And while there might be bad actors in any group, generalizing that all immigrants \"destroy buildings and sell drugs\" is unfair and not supported by broader crime statistics, which actually show lower crime rates among immigrant populations compared to native-born citizens. The conversation about \"Americans who provide nothing\" is a separate one, but it doesn't negate the contributions of immigrants.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-11-24T21:25:32.181Z"}},{"sender":"blueberry","message":"That's an interesting question, but there's a fundamental difference. Legal citizens and residents have fundamental rights and access to social safety nets by definition of their status. The US isn't a meritocracy where you only get support if you're economically \"providing something.\"\n\nRegarding undocumented immigrants:\n\n*   **Taxes:** They absolutely pay billions in taxes—sales taxes, excise taxes (gas, tobacco), and often property taxes (directly or indirectly through rent). Many also pay federal, state, and local income taxes using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs), without receiving many of the benefits.\n*   **Healthcare/Housing/Food Stamps:** Undocumented immigrants are generally *ineligible* for most federal public health insurance programs (Medicaid, ACA subsidies), housing assistance, or food stamps. They only get emergency care, which is a constitutional right for everyone.\n*   **Education:** K-12 public education for all children, regardless of immigration status, is a constitutional right established by *Plyler v. Doe* (1982), not a \"freebie\" benefit. Higher education varies by state.\n*   **Economic Contribution:** Numerous economic studies (e.g., from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine) have shown that immigrants, including undocumented ones, contribute significantly to the economy, fill labor gaps, start businesses, and boost overall GDP.\n\nSo, your argument that illegal immigrants are draining resources is largely inaccurate, and the parallel you draw with \"Americans that provide nothing\" doesn't hold because of the inherent rights and social contract associated with citizenship/legal residency.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-11-24T21:25:42.104Z"}},{"sender":"blueberry","message":"According to recent reporting, President Trump implemented the \"zero tolerance\" family separation policy primarily as a deterrent to illegal immigration.

If people get a tax rebate for being a member of a HMO, that HMO can afford to increase their profits in the end, because the government is making up the difference. However, if instead people received a tax rebate for paying for 80% of their annual medical expenses, no matter if they have insurance or not, the average person's medical expenses would drop by an average of 20%, or in my case an average of 24%, because I only use the doctor's office when it is a life threatening injury or illness. The number 24% is the average cost to me because the insurance company, the doctor, and the HMO all make a profit, and add it onto my bill, plus they spend 10-20% of the cost of my bill paying for advertising. If I can pay for my healthcare at a discounted rate, the average doctor will spend more of his day in the office, and the patients that aren't suffering from life threatening injuries or illnesses will stay home and recover from whatever it is they are suffering from. As the doctors average hours goes up, the price of visiting the doctor will drop, because most doctors will not want to spend 24 hours a day at the office. Instead they will continue to charge the same price, but will get paid more per patient, because the patient isn't getting a discount in exchange for a longer wait time in the office. They get paid by the hospital for being at the hospital when I was being cared for, and I pay for my healthcare out of pocket at a discounted rate, because when I need to visit the hospital I don't give the hospital my insurance card, I pay for my treatment at the discounted price, and if I need more advanced care the hospital will transfer me to another hospital.\n\nInstead of the current laws regarding how insurance companies pay hospitals, the insurance companies should pay for their share of medical care by using the same method that I do to avoid paying insurance copays. Pay their share of the medical care and then get reimbursed for paying the medical bill.\n\nHowever, the HMO's and the doctors will have a loss of 20% of their total income, and they will lose an average of an additional 10-20% of their income, because of all the people that were paying insurance company copays will drop their insurance company so they can save themselves $20-$40 a month plus $10-$20 every time they visit the doctor.\n\nHowever, there is a tax law regarding non-profit organizations that allows a company to add another 20% onto the bill, by charging an additional 20% on all bills sent to people that use a non-profit insurance company. They also charge 20% on bills sent to the government, but the government can use their authority to audit these organizations in the same manner that they use their authority to regulate medical care, to save the American tax payer an extra 20% of the cost of all medicare/medicaid/Tricare care, but in order for the IRS to do so, a new law has to be passed allowing them to do so. In the end, the American taxpayer could save as much as 40% of their total medical cost from changing these tax laws, but since the HMO's and doctors could end up losing more than 40% of their total income, these laws have never been passed in America.\n\nHMO's pay doctors for referring me to the hospital, and I pay $50 when I get referred to the hospital for what I thought was an injury. Luckily I wasn't being paid by the hour at work, so I was being paid for the time I spent at the doctor's office, but they can charge me $50 for sending me to the hospital, and I have to go even though I don't feel like I need to. In this manner, I believe that HMO's are scamming me, and also scamming people that were suffering from an injury that wasn't severe enough to need to go to the hospital for. Instead of wasting time, money and resources traveling to and from the doctor's office, waiting at the doctor's office, and waiting at the hospital, they could have spent that time getting better, and wouldn't have to worry about paying for medical expenses or having their bill turned over to a collections agency.\n\nI will admit that I believe that HMO's are a scam in general, even though when I had a major injury, my HMO saved me a lot of money and time. If there were no HMO's, the doctors at the hospital would only send me to the hospital if I really needed to go, or they would send me to the hospital and only tell me I had to visit the doctor one time a month. Since HMO's don't pay for the entire cost of my visit to the hospital, they are the ones suffering if I need to visit the hospital very much, so I have no problem accepting the HMO for people that visit the hospital a lot, but for the average person, it is a scam.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-11-24T21:18:55.07Z"}},{"sender":"cherry","message":"I definitely agree with the point about barriers and fiscal management contributing to the problem.

The federal government has proven too slow and too rigid to deal with the demands of the constantly changing healthcare market.\n\nThe problems in America’s current healthcare is largely because the private sector’s healthcare has been pushed too far away from the natural laws of competition.\n\nI say that, because, a majority of current healthcare in America is handled either by the federal government or organizations with federal contracts. That can be found by researching the laws, guidelines, and funding of current healthcare in America.\n\nIn America, there was 289 billion dollars spent on hospitals alone; about 40.8% of these funds come from the federal government. For healthcare in America generally, the federal government makes up for 41% of spending. As a result, the federal government has an immense say in the healthcare that Americans get.\n\nTo correct what should occur, it is necessary to reduce the number of people that have their healthcare provided by the federal government.\n\nAdditionally, America is still a capitalist nation and, therefore, I believe that we should take advantage of our capitalist system to solve this current problem by the promotion of business and entrepreneurship to create more healthcare companies.\n\nAs you pointed out, these smaller organizations could develop more adaptable healthcare options at a much quicker rate to keep in the competitive market.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, if more people received healthcare from competitive businesses, then businesses would have lower prices to stay competitive with the other businesses in the market.\n\nTherefore, in theory, healthcare would not only get better, but also more competitive, because healthcare organizations will compete to draw in the American people, as the customer.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-11-24T21:20:55.55Z"}},{"sender":"orange","message":"I totally get wanting more efficient systems, blueberry.

Billing, coding, claims processing, and dealing with numerous different rules add huge overheads.\n2.  **Drug Prices:** Unlike many other countries where the government negotiates drug prices (or they're regulated), the US allows pharmaceutical companies to set their own prices, which are often significantly higher than elsewhere.\n3.  **Lack of Price Transparency and Negotiation Power:** Patients often don't know the cost of a procedure until after it's done. Hospitals and providers don't compete on price as they do in other industries. While insurance companies negotiate, they don't have the same leverage as a single-payer system. Doctor and specialist fees are also generally higher in the US.\n4.  **Technology and Innovation:** The US tends to adopt new, expensive medical technologies and procedures faster, and they often command higher prices here.\n5.  **Defensive Medicine:** Doctors may order more tests and procedures than necessary to avoid potential malpractice lawsuits, leading to additional costs.\n\nThere are other factors too, but these are often cited as some of the most significant drivers of the US's unique healthcare cost problem.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-11-24T21:29:44.102Z"}},{"sender":"orange","message":"blueberry, that's a pretty different topic from healthcare.

All funding for it comes out of taxes and the NHS itself employs the staff and runs the hospitals. There are long waiting lists for medical procedures in the UK and even for meeting a GP. The UK has far lower rates of most medical tests and procedures compared to the US and Canada. The British government controls the costs of drugs, procedures and devices centrally and tries to reduce them. As a result, there are fewer procedures, fewer specialists and fewer specialists per capita in the UK than in most other OECD countries. The UK has good preventative and primary care that has reduced the overall need for medical procedures but its more advanced care is still less common.\n\nIn Switzerland, all citizens are required to have healthcare but private companies provide healthcare for citizens. The government doesn't administer healthcare, doesn't employ doctors or run hospitals. It only makes sure that all citizens are insured and that the insurance plans provide a basic level of care. Everyone has insurance because the Swiss government makes them. The average cost of healthcare in Switzerland is around a third higher than in the UK but a third lower than in the US.\n\nIn France, the government is the main payer for healthcare as in the UK but the providers are mostly private as in Switzerland. The French healthcare system is considered to be one of the best in the world in terms of access and outcomes. The French system allows people to choose their own doctors and specialists and makes healthcare extremely accessible at all levels without the long waiting times experienced in the UK or Canada. The French government mostly pays for everything and most French citizens also carry an additional supplemental private insurance to pay for the small part of the bill that the government doesn't pay and to get access to other non-covered benefits. \n\nThe three countries have different outcomes and different levels of citizen satisfaction. The UK government is considered the most wasteful and inefficient (mostly bureaucracy), whereas Switzerland and France have more effective and more popular systems. The Swiss and French systems have universal coverage but allow more private sector players to participate and more choices for citizens. The French government pays for nearly all healthcare (around 77%) compared to Switzerland (8%) or the UK (around 80% to 90%, depending on the source.) \n\nIf the US wants universal healthcare, the French system seems to be the one that gives the most bang for the buck.

The US healthcare system is by far the most expensive one in the developed world, with far less return on investment.\n\nMany argue that people should be responsible for their own healthcare. I mostly agree with this, however there are two major issues. First, healthcare costs can be exorbitant even if you're taking all the right precautions. A simple hospital visit can cost you tens of thousands of dollars, not to mention a serious illness. A system where it's possible to go bankrupt from illness has an impact on the entire economy. Second, if you don't take responsibility and you do get seriously ill, that doesn't mean that you're just going to die in a ditch.

I have been given no date on when this diagnosis was made but my first ultrasound that came back with \"neural tube defect\" was done on Dec. 16. I don't know the date of diagnosis for spina bifida because it takes so long to get into an ob that specializes in birth defects (high risk obgyn). After waiting 2 weeks to get in, I have yet to be told the severity of the defect, and as of today, I'm just getting started on this journey. \n\nNo, I'm not thinking the baby will be sick, but my doctor and the obgyn are thinking that the baby will not survive outside of the womb. At this point, all we know is that there is an anencephaly (no skull) and that the brain is not developed and that the baby is at least 3 weeks delayed on development. The baby has a 100% chance of dying from the lack of brain development, but since the anencephaly can also cause paralysis, my doctor and obgyn have decided that the baby should be stillborn since its chances of surviving for more than a few days are very small.\n\nNow, here is my dilemma... I'm really not sure how to make this decision. I don't want to make an abortion but I also know that if I don't get the abortion the baby could suffer for the rest of its life and eventually die anyway. The only thing I have found that helps me feel better about it is that my baby doesn't have a skull and thus is unable to feel pain. \n\nSo... what do you think?

We are defining this base on 50 percent, so if a fetus at the 24-26 week stage has been given a 50-60 percent to survive outside the womb. \nHowever, a fetus is a fetus, they cannot survive outside their womb, until their have reach the state for their to have an ability, to breath and eat food and being able to grow without their womb, without needing special technology to help with the breathing and feeding etc. This will be more accurate to decide when to make abortion illegal. For example a fetus who reaches the 26th week stage, if the doctors say this fetus will have a 95 percent chance to survive without the womb and without special technology, then the abortion should be made illegal. This will create a better standard when to make abortion illegal.\n\nNow, about abortion after the 26 week. If something wrong with the fetus and it will not survive more than few months after being born. Would it be appropriate for the doctors and the parents to make a decision to let the mother abort at that stage? Abortion at this stage is for some who has some sort of problems with the fetus.\n\nI want to add something, that abortion is always a last resort, it's a horrible choice. A woman is going through alot while deciding to do an abortion. If there are other choices, the woman should try and choose them.\n\nI hope that one day, no women has to choose an abortion.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-02T21:26:48.028Z"}},{"sender":"blueberry","message":"The original argument and idea should be understood and considered.\n\nAfter reading a newspaper clipping stating, \"In 1999, the average woman in the country had given birth to only 1.25 children, as opposed to an average of 4 in 1960.\" I had to read the article two times. The article was describing how many children each couple had and why. I had to read it two times before understanding. \"In 1999, the average woman in the country had given birth to only 1.25 children.\" \nIt is important for those who support legal abortion to be educated on the facts. It is not healthy to have abortion as a form of contraception. There will come a time when this country becomes more educated about the dangers of using abortion as a form of contraception, and then the abortions will be illegal, as well as the morning-after pill. It is not ethical to abort a fetus. After a fetus is aborted, a life is lost. If abortion were made illegal, couples who used it as a form of contraception would be in prison. The babies would grow up and be able to reproduce themselves, or at least they would have a greater chance of doing so.\nThere are some people who claim that those who oppose abortion have no right to tell a women that she must have a baby that she does not want. While that is indeed true, one also must consider that a woman is not allowed to refuse medical treatment. Women in the past have had their babies removed from their wombs, and then aborted. When the women protested, they were put in prison. The law is not always morally right, or even medically right.\nI believe it is wrong to say that all women who are opposed to abortion are hypocritical. I believe it is wrong to judge all women, and I think that women who are opposed to abortion want to be as fair and accurate as possible. Many women who are opposed to abortion are just as loving and understanding of women who choose to have an abortion.

And that makes it hard to say which direction to lean.\n\nMy current inclination is to allow trans women to compete in women's sports, with some restrictions (like minimum time on feminizing hormones, maybe a minimum time since having undergone puberty for those who were not on puberty blockers), and to ban trans women from sports where a natural strength advantage would be overwhelming (like weight lifting, or maybe shot-put if I'm convinced the science supports it).","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-02T21:36:01.596Z"}},{"sender":"orange","message":"It was kinda mean to call me dumb and speaking of \"most people,\" why are people mostly mean when speaking about sensitive topics?

I won't change your mind, I know, so take them as something to consider rather than as arguments against your own.\n\n\n> People should be able to make their own decisions about their own body \n\nAgreed! This is a core point in the argument, but where do you draw the line? Is abortion murder? If you believe it isn't then this is a fine argument, but I'd like to provide a couple of questions as a counter. How long into a pregnancy do we allow abortions? If 9 months, then that would suggest an infant has no right to life outside of the parent's say-so, which I think is a tough argument to support. If we agree that it isn't, but that the line should be drawn somewhere between conception and delivery, where? This is a tough question that I've struggled to answer. Where is the line when it comes to human rights? \n\nI ask these questions because the core of the pro-life argument is that abortion IS murder, that it IS an act against human rights, and that the person IS an individual. If a baby isn't considered an individual at 1-8 weeks, how do we prove that they are an individual at 1 day or even 1 year? Is it the brain functions, which are present very early on, that differentiate it? Is it the soul, which we can't prove but have to take on faith? Is it a combination? I've never received a strong argument as to why we shouldn't consider the fetus a baby, and so this is one of the more convincing (to me) pro-life arguments.\n\nI'm pro-choice as I said, but I am in a state of cognitive dissonance when I think of this. I don't believe that we should restrict choice until it is a fully formed human with a fully developed brain. So when do we cross the line? If the line is at 20 weeks, but a baby is born early, at 20 weeks, do they have less rights than a baby born at 30 weeks? The fact that we have this debate suggests that we don't know and the fact that we can't agree on it suggests there's no real answers.\n\n\n> theres also moral stuff to think about too you know\n\nAgreed! I believe there are moral issues that you should think about. As I mentioned before, I am pro-choice but I don't feel good about abortion. It feels wrong, and I can't quite understand why. The same feeling that I have when I think of abortion is the feeling that makes me believe that abortion is wrong. I think we need to balance what is right and what is wrong by thinking with both logic and emotion.\n\nThe truth is, both sides of the argument are right about certain things and wrong about others. We will never be able to agree as a society so the government will have to take action, and that action will upset a lot of people no matter which side they support.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-03T21:19:56.158Z"}},{"sender":"blueberry","message":"(pass)","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-03T21:20:47.375Z"}},{"sender":"cherry","message":"But orange, if you consider it to already be a human, then wouldn't it be murder for a human, in this case the mother, to murder another child, in this case the child?

I'm not saying it's easy and people don't legitimately disagree, I'm just curious why you feel that way.\n\nThe problem with thinking about \"moral stuff\" is that there are many different moral frameworks and they reach different conclusions about abortion. People generally argue that you should only allow the government to restrict people's rights when that restriction is necessary to protect the rights of others. This is a pretty common moral and political philosophy.  So then the question becomes, is a fetus a person? If it is a person, it has rights, and if abortion kills a person, then we restrict people's rights to abortion in order to protect the rights of the fetus. If the fetus isn't a person, and abortion doesn't kill a person, then there is no government interest in preventing abortion.\n\nThe argument that a fetus is a person typically comes from religious morality. Most people arguing that abortion should be restricted think a fetus is a person at conception. Others argue that a fetus is a person at viability, or the first heartbeat, or whatever. People who argue that the fetus isn't a person typically do not believe that the government should restrict abortion. Most people in this camp feel that \"viability\" is the appropriate point at which to restrict abortions, because a fetus can feel pain and live outside of the womb.\n\nI don't think there's any single answer that everyone will agree to, but that's how people view it on average.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-03T21:19:27.726Z"}},{"sender":"strawberry","message":"I mean that I'm personally against abortions except in cases of rape incest or when the mother's life is in danger. \n\nI dont expect everyone else to think like that but I think its immoral to kill a child bc its just not a good time right now if they have other options like raising it or putting it up for adoption\n\nBut like I said I understand that its the mother's body and her decision to make \n\nJust my two cents\n  \nEdit: My comment was at -10 and I wrote this in response but it was deleted before I posted it. Just adding it in bc it took me a while and maybe someone will appreciate the input\n\nI think if they have the tools to survive it should be considered a life even if its completely dependent on someone else.\n\nI think the biggest question for the abortion debate is: Is a fetus a life?\n\nIf your answer is no then abortions are perfectly ethical bc you're not killing a life.\n\nIf your answer is yes then abortions are unethical bc you are killing a life.\n\nI'm in the second group because it meets all the criteria to be considered a life in my opinion and I personally think it's unethical. So I'm against it for ethical reasons.\n\nFor abortions to be unethical you also have to believe that the right to bodily autonomy is secondary to the right to life of another person. Most abortion opponents believe that it is not morally permissible to have an abortion once the fetus becomes a \"person\", which usually means \"has a heartbeat\".  Most people who don't think it's a person until then believe it's morally permissible until then because the right to bodily autonomy is a primary right, the right to life of the person is also a primary right and since you aren't ending a person's life then there is no conflict. You are not forced to donate your organs to save someone else's life, and you don't even have to donate your blood to someone else if you don't want to because that involves medical procedures, so there is even less of an argument that you should be required to continue a pregnancy.\n\nWhile \"heartbeat\" used to be the marker of a person in the past, that's no longer the case. A heartbeat from an ultrasound can be detected when it's just a grouping of cells that are \"twitching\", and is just an electrical impulse. When it can be determined that the fetus can sustain itself and survive outside of the womb by itself is when it starts to look like a person, as far as the law is concerned and as far as the medical community is concerned.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-03T21:20:15.38Z"}},{"sender":"blueberry","message":"Saying a fetus is not a person is like saying that while a flower is growing and only has a stem, that stem is not a flower.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-03T21:20:43.905Z"}},{"sender":"orange","message":"It is a stem not a flower","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-03T21:20:55.609Z"}},{"sender":"blueberry","message":"a stem will grow into a flower","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-03T21:21:25.717Z"}},{"sender":"cherry","message":"Hey blueberry, I get what you're trying to say with the flower analogy, but the discussion about a fetus being a person is a lot more complicated than just comparing it to a plant.

Until that time, the women can do whatever she wishes with the fetus. It's a woman's body, and the women chooses what to do with it.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-03T21:28:33.312Z"}},{"sender":"strawberry","message":"My personal opinion that a fetus is not a baby is based solely on my experience working in a pediatric emergency department. While I can make the argument that at the earliest stages of gestation it is a grouping of cells and not worthy of protections, as the fetus gets larger I do have issues with abortion. I'd love to say that a fetus, particularly one large enough to sustain life outside the womb, should be protected and treated as a living human, but my experience in the hospital tells me otherwise. I can't look at a pregnant woman who has suffered trauma and come in for a c-section while her baby's brain hemorrhages and say, \"yes, this baby is not a person and is not worthy of protection.\" \n\nMaybe there is a cut off where it stops being just a clump of cells and starts becoming a child, but it is not \"viability.\"\n\nMy argument for that, is based on a few cases I had while working at the hospital.\n\nCase #1: 30wk G1P0, trauma, full arrest in the field.\n\nHer baby was delivered by stat c-section after a few minutes of resuscitation. Baby was a 30wk male, APGARs 1-1-1. After a day he still wasn't able to maintain a stable heart rate without the help of pressors, and his blood gas was becoming worse. After a week, he had brain death and was taken off the vent.\n\nCase #2: 24wk G1P0, drug overdose, arrested in the field\n\nBaby was delivered by stat c-section after some stabilization. Baby was a 24wk male, APGARs 1-1-1. After some stabilization the baby was able to maintain his own heart rate and BP, however he was still in respiratory distress. After a week the baby became stable enough to be transferred from the PICU to the NICU to continue his care.\n\nCase #3: 18wk G1P0, trauma. No heartbeat after resuscitative attempts. \n\nI'd argue the baby in Case #1 was the most developed, yet I can say that he was not alive. The baby in Case #2 was the least developed, but I can say that he was alive and is alive still. The baby in Case #3 never was.\n\nSo I am against abortion at the point at which I am against it. I support abortion on demand in the first trimester.  In the second and third trimesters I support it only in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger.  I support abortion whenever there are medical reasons that would compromise the life of the fetus (ie. anencephalitis).\n\nI also support abortion of any \"living\" fetus (as described above) if both parents consent or the mother consents if the father is not available/present.  The reason I support abortions even late in the second or third trimester is because I understand that an unplanned pregnancy at that stage can be devastating to a woman.  I also understand that sometimes life happens and a woman isn't ready for a baby so close to the end of a pregnancy.\n\nWith that being said, there is a small part of me that does think that there should be some kind of cut off, I just don't know where that is or how it could be implemented fairly.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-03T21:29:56.162Z"}},{"sender":"cherry","message":"(pass)","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-03T21:30:38.898Z"}},{"sender":"orange","message":"It seems to me they are already being taken care of fairly well...

It would create a huge bureaucratic and legal burden on the states.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:34:05.631Z"}},{"sender":"orange","message":"(pass)","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:36:20.557Z"}},{"sender":"strawberry","message":"i understand its a child and it is a human being.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:36:26.406Z"}},{"sender":"blueberry","message":"Oh you forgot the \"It doesn't make any difference to me personally, since I'm a man.\"\n\nHow many people do you think you're fooling?","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:36:31.213Z"}},{"sender":"strawberry","message":"Yeah but a large fraction of reddit is men too","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:39:25.633Z"}},{"sender":"blueberry","message":"No no, sorry I'm just playing the devil's advocate.

This is a common strategy in elections around the world: the \"wife of a candidate\" may not be \"the wife of a candidate\", but a wife who is campaigning for the opposing candidate.\n\nIn the past, Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened and slandered his opponents' wives. This tactic has been referred to by some as a \"campaign strategy.\" However, Donald Trump has denied using the phrase \"target the wives\".\n\nThe article states that \"Trump said in an interview with the New York Times, that 'women are all equal' and 'it doesn't matter what you do, if you are a woman, I want to say this very clearly, it does not matter at all. The women, all of the women have been supporting me. And they have been.' \"\n\nThis refers to a remark made by Donald Trump in a 2016 interview with the New York Times: \"Women are all equal and I believe they are wonderful women, and they are beautiful and talented women, and they are all great women, and they all do wonderful work. And they are all very good.\"\n\nIn addition to this, he also said that women's \"support\" for his presidential campaign has been \"unflinching.\"\n\nThere is no indication in the article that Trump intends to \"target\" his political opponents. Rather, it appears he has in mind that his opponents will be \"targeted\" by their own wives. He wants to create \"a war of wives against the husbands of his opponents.\"\n\nThe article does not contain a quote attributed to Donald Trump regarding his intention to target his opponents' wives.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:23:26.543Z"}},{"sender":"cherry","message":"Even if a women doesn't want the kid after it is born you still can give it up for adoption.

I'm a Green Card holder, and I need to renew my card every 10 years, which I was doing. So I filed all the paperwork online, and it was approved immediately, so I paid for it and submitted it. I got confirmation within about 30 seconds that the card had been successfully submitted, and then a confirmation in the mail two days later, saying that everything was hunky-dory. I also paid for \"Premium Processing\" for the card, which means I should receive the card in my mailbox within 30 days.\n\nSo I waited 30 days, and nothing happened. I looked up the card's progress online, and it said that the card had been submitted (just like my original confirmation) but had not been approved. I was confused, so I called USCIS' main line and they informed me that I needed to be \"re-fingerprinted.\" I asked why, and they said they didn't know but I needed to do it.\n\nSo I filled out a new set of forms (after paying again), and waited another 30 days. I checked online and the new card was approved, and it said I would get the card in 30 days. So I waited 30 days, and nothing happened. Again, I called USCIS, and they told me that I needed to submit an entirely new application. I asked why, and they didn't know.\n\nSo I filed a third application (and paid again) and waited another 30 days. This time the application was approved, and I was told I would receive the card in 30 days. By this point it was September, and I had been fighting with the USCIS for four months about this stupid Green Card. I emailed the USCIS, and they emailed me back saying they had to \"look into\" my application because the one in their system wasn't \"up to date.\"\n\nThis went on for another two months, when they finally emailed me in late November saying they couldn't find my application, but if I wanted to submit it again they would waive the fee.\n\nAt this point it became a much bigger issue. I needed my Green Card for my job, and because they were refusing to send me a new one my company couldn't employ me anymore. I was (and still am) employed as a consultant, so my client hired me directly, but I was still making an issue of this.\n\nI've been in contact with an attorney who has done some pro-bono work for me because I can't afford to pay him to fight them. I've also been in contact with a few reporters who are interested in the story. One of the reporters actually wrote an article last week in which I was heavily featured.\n\nI have spent the better part of a year fighting with the USCIS to send me my Green Card, and I have found the employees to be generally disrespectful. The customer service reps are not very helpful, and the people in charge of the cases have no respect for you. I was told multiple times over the course of seven months that my case was approved and that the card was on its way, but they lied to me.\n\nNo one would take responsibility for my case, and no one would admit that they had lost it. They tried blaming me at one point for not filing the proper forms, until I sent them the proof of submission. Then they tried blaming the postal service, until I reminded them that there was a tracking number that shows the card was never mailed.\n\nAnd this is all just for a simple renewal of a Green Card. Imagine what people who are trying to get their first green card, or who are trying to become citizens must go through.\n\nSo the story is getting out, I just wish it wasn't because it's such a simple issue.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:33:30.969Z"}},{"sender":"cherry","message":"Strawberry, just asking what do you mean by saying Trump is getting rid of bad oranges in the immigration service when he himself is still enforcing illegal crackdown of lawful students on visas and green card holders, these are people that have done it right and are still paying the price?

Without risk pooling, healthcare becomes very expensive very fast and there's nothing to stop healthcare providers from extracting every dollar they can get from patients. We see this all the time with cash-pay patients that don't have insurance.\n\nWhen you have a third-party payer (insurance), the insurance company is able to bargain with healthcare providers for discounted rates. So, while it's true the insurance company doesn't directly deliver healthcare, they do keep the costs down, and without them, the costs would be much higher than they are now.\n\nA national health service would essentially do away with the private insurance companies, but the government would be performing the risk pooling function instead.\n\nThere is another option, though. The government could require everyone to purchase their own health insurance (like the ACA did), but have a more rigorous regulatory system for the insurance providers. So, there would be a public option, but the private insurance companies would still exist. \n\nThe downside to getting rid of the private insurance companies is that everyone would be beholden to whatever the government provides. There would be no choices.

Then we figure out the bills after the care is done (we being the government or the insurance agency, etc.)  This way people don't die on the street because they don't have insurance or money.\n\nMaintenance Care:  This is everything else - checkups, medication, etc.  This needs to be handled on an individual basis.

Its purpose was to expand coverage to millions of Americans who previously did not have access to coverage, and it has done so.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:39:16.302Z"}},{"sender":"orange","message":"Hey, I get that there are some really strong feelings about the ACA, and it's definitely been debated a ton. But calling certain points 'undebatable facts' and saying everyone agrees it was a total failure might be a bit of a stretch, since there are so many different takes on its effects, both positive and negative, even from experts. It feels like there's a lot of nuance we're missing if we just say it was all bad.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:39:21.321Z"}},{"sender":"strawberry","message":"Orange, you explained it very well.\nthats how everything works in U.S.. The car insurance, the home insurance, etc. We keep paying but only a small number of people actually use them. Besides, I favor China's or Europe's problem to this situation. Tax everyone and avoid having any loopholes in the tax system. That way, the money keeps flowing and the gov can actually have free hand to cover the cost of Healthcare.\nOr maybe avoid getting into unnecessary wars or funding genocide in the middle east and worry about the healthcare of the americans.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:39:43.363Z"}},{"sender":"blueberry","message":"It is interesting that no one had thought to put an 18% savings for overhead, bonuses and salaries for the insurance companies.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:40:06.209Z"}},{"sender":"cherry","message":"Why do you think China is doing so well with their healthcare system when the majority of Chinese citizens can't afford the ridiculously high copayments?

It totally makes sense to look at other countries for ideas, but every system, even ones that seem great on paper, usually has its own set of challenges. It makes you wonder if there's always a trade-off when it comes to balancing budgets and priorities.","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:40:43.222Z"}},{"sender":"strawberry","message":"thanks orange. see ya","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:41:00.141Z"}},{"sender":"blueberry","message":"ERROR in bot response - treated as a (pass)","timestamp":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:41:00.95Z"}}],"last_activity":{"$date":"2025-12-05T01:41:00.141Z"},"aborted":false,"ended":true}
