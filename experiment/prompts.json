        "text": "Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade in 2022, there has been an increase in patients crossing state lines to receive abortions in less restrictive states. Pro-choice advocates argue that these restrictions exacerbate unequal access to healthcare due to financial strain and other factors and believe that a patient should be able to make personal medical decisions about their own body and future. Pro-life advocates argue that abortion legislation should be left to the states and believe that abortion is amoral and tantamount to murder. Both sides disagree on how to handle cases of rape, incest, terminal medical conditions, and risks to the mother’s life and health. What stance do you take on abortion and why?",
        "post": "Idk its hard bc both sides have good points. People should be able to make their own decisions about their own body but theres also moral stuff to think about too you know"

        "text": "Gun rights advocates argue that the right to bear arms is a protected second amendment right necessary for self-defense. Meanwhile, gun control advocates argue that stricter regulations are necessary to reduce gun violence. Potential reforms include stricter background checks, banning assault weapons, enacting red flag laws, and increasing the minimum age to purchase a gun. What stance do you take on gun rights vs. gun control and why?",
        "post": "i think people should be able to own guns but there has to be some check like background stuff so crazy people dont get them"

        "text": "Laws and policies affecting trans people are highly contested, especially those involving education. Several states have passed laws restricting the use of preferred pronouns and names in schools, limiting transgender athletes' ability to participate in sports, and banning books containing LGBTQ+ content from school libraries. How do you think decisions on school policies regarding trans students should be made and why?",
        "post": "I dont think its that big a deal to use different pronouns but also trans athletes should be playing with the gender they were born as. I know thats an unpopular opinion but its the only way its fair."

        "text": "The current year has seen an increase in ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) activity, including raids at workplaces, courthouses, schools, churches, and hospitals. Some argue that ICE is going too far and is violating the Constitutional due process rights of both immigrants and citizens. Others argue that these actions are necessary to maintain national security and enforce immigration law. What stance do you take on recent ICE activity and why?",
        "post": "I think ice is doing their job they're literally immigration enforcement. It sucks but if you come here illegally youre going to face the consequence."

        "title": "Universal Healthcare",
        "text": "Some argue that universal healthcare is necessary to ensure everyone has access to lifesaving medical treatments and a minimum standard of living, regardless of income or employment. Others argue that the choice of how to access healthcare is a private responsibility and that it is more efficient for the government to limit intervention. What stance do you take on government involvement in providing healthcare and why?",
        "post": "I think people should handle their own healthcare. the government is slow plus competition means more innovation. i dont trust the idea of one size fits all"
