# Decisions

1. We'll train bots with all data (even toxic) and self-censor them "on the way
   out" (rather than withholding toxic data during training).
1. We will hide the fact that we are focusing on political dialogue from
   participants before the experiment, in addition to the fact that they will
   interact with bots.
1. The experiment will begin with participants freely choosing from a small
   number of topics. This way they can "self-select out" of anything they might
   find triggering. And this way, we won't need any "abort" button.
