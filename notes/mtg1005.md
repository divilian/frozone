# Frozone Meeting 10/5/2025 (Zoom, with Bethanie and Laur both sick).

* Conversation about the experiment, which evolved into "is this really about
  social media anyway?" Main points and conclusions:
    * GM and NF say: "most people don't normally comment at all (on something
      like Reddit/Twitter) normally"
    * Reddit and Discord are very different
    * Our experiment is really about Discord-ish scenarios, which is also
      important to address in our society. Also, we can make the case in the
      paper that some lessons from the Discord-ish scenario are probably
      applicable to "real" social media.


* Conversation about "what do we conceal from participants before chat room
  opens?"

- that we're a bot (yes)
- that we're interested in political topics (LR: probably not possible, if we
  give them a sample of starter questions to choose from)

SD's conclusion, post-meeting: We give them a sample list of topics, and from
that moment on the "cat is out of the bag" as far as "oh, they're researching
politics" goes. But this is not a problem, since this only revealed seconds
before they actually begin the chatroom, at which point we can hardly conceal
that this is about politics.

* SD drops the "use LLMs to run the whole show" bomb, and demo.
