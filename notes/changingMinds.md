# What actually works in changing people's minds?

From the literature, I want to make lists of strategies that empirically are, and are not, effective in changing people's political opinions. (I realize that "changing one's opinion" and "having healthy discourse" are not identical. But the former is important, too, and it's easier to measure.)

Please add to this list as you encounter things related to this question. It would probably be dumb to program our 'bot to implement strategies that have been empirically proven not to work.

(All papers cited below should be added to the "people changing opinions" Z folder.)

## Effective

* _Redlawsk et al 2010_ says that consuming negative information about a preferred candidate will _eventually_ convince a person to become anxious, and finally turn against the candidate. Large volume is required, however.

## Not effective

* _Redlawsk et al 2010_ says that until reaching a saturation point, encountering negative information about a preferred candidate actually results in the person _more strongly_ supporting that candidate.

* _Tak√°cs et al 2016_ says that **negative influence** is a myth: if you hear someone you dislike-or-generally-disagree-with assert something, you _won't_ generally disagree with that something as a result, as is commonly thought.
