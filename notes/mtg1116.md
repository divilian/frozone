# Frozone Meeting 11/16/2025 (Zoom).

We're getting close to **E-Day**!!

Big things that must be done by Thursday:

1. The chat app must be able to talk to models (duh)
    1. Get it to talk "at all" to Gemini. (BH/LR)
        1. Authentication problem?
        2. The prompt you send has the following back-to-back:
            1. The hot/cool/fro prompt (with 'you are blueberry' in there)
            2. The whole chat history
        3. Have it talk to an OBVIOUSLY tuned model. (pirate) (SD)
    2. Get the models tuned properly to be hot/cool/fro. (SD/GM)
        1. What exactly do we give Google as "the system instructions" for the
           fine-tuning procedure?
    3. Firm up the final prompts!!! (NF/GM)
2. Sign-up sheets: get these from instructors by Friday.
3. Are we robust to participants accidentally: (BH/LR; anything that remains
   we'll diagnose on Thursday.)
    1. Back arrow?
    1. Leaving the page?
    1. Refresh the page?
    1. Different cookie settings?
4. SD: ask JZ if it's okay to invite more than DATA 101 / CPSC 110? (Ignore
   GM's bad ethics)
5. Decide on how to allocate experimental IDs? (000#?, for stealth)
6. Train the proctors.
