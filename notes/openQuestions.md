# Open questions

1. Will the experimental chat room be a round-robin? A response to individuals?
    A free-for-all?

1. Should the detectors operate on individual posts? Or most recent _k_ posts?
    Or something else?

1. Once we have a mix of sources that do (1) echo chamber-y discussions, and
    (2) heated back-and-forths, (3) polite interaction, what percentage of each
    do we include?

1. Thinking big: is there any way to measure someone's understanding of
    information after the chatroom experience? (So that the benefits of Frobot
    are longer-lasting than just "the chat was more productive?")

1. How do we synthesize (or just choose between) responses when multiple
    detectors are triggered?
