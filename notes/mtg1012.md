# Frozone Meeting 10/12/2025 (Zoom).

## Scheduling

* Our timeline just got moved up for submitting IRB approval, since it needs to
  be approved before class announcements. Let's plan dates for all this.


## Conclusions on ChatGPT's ability to detect/respond to:

1. misinfo (LR)
1. bias (GM)
1. fallacies (BH)
1. toxicity (NF)
1. misrepresentation (SD)

## Plan for moving forward

1. Address "tone" issues.
1. ???

## Architecture

* [VM specs](https://chatgpt.com/share/68e28350-8824-8007-a80a-6c76abd603ec)

* ["Prompt-only" considerations](https://chatgpt.com/share/68ec2292-075c-8007-bc37-748a61492223)

## Process

* Do we want a "SD is maintainer and others submit PR's" culture, or a
  "everybody has push permissions to the main branch" culture?


## Zotero "happy chaos"

Let's start doing some more organizing. (Reminder: items can and should
sometimes be in multiple collections.)

* Type of result
    * datasets (e.g., toxicity/Poudhar 2024)
    * models (e.g., toxicity/Caselli 2021)
    * user studies (e.g., toxicity/Hangartner 2021)
    * applications (e.g., tools/Argyle 2023)

* trim some things we've discovered are far afield?

* ...?

* Do we like a separate `datasets.md` file, or should this information just be
  in Zotero?
