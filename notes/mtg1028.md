# Frozone Meeting 10/28/2025 (in person).

## The budget

Details:
* Frozone instance (BH says approximately $300)
* Web search API (Tabule) no more than $100, GM promises
* Vertex AI API ($400 only once we have a final fine-tuning training set)
    * maybe an additional $400
    * fine-tuning
    * deployment

Verdict: we're under budget, but not super comfortably so. We can't waste
resources with no worries.

## The "suspend-and-resume Frozone instance" procedure

* Stephen will check every midnight and suspend if necessary.

## Fine-tuning process

* Open questions:
    * Can we fine-tune a fine-tuned model, or does it start from scratch each
      time
    * Is there a problem using ChatGPT to help us create the sentences
    * Where do the five of us get our made-up text/response pairs?

* GM will get us all on Gemini 2.5 Pro soon soon soon

* Doing the fine-tuning process:
    * will this cost money each time we fine-tune?
    * how often will we be fine-tune?

* Someone will write a script that lets everybody interact with gemini the same
  way we do with chatpgt (it just accumulates the ever-growing prompt)

## Catch Stephen up on prompts

* highlight reels

* latest changes to prompts

## NURVa slides run-through
