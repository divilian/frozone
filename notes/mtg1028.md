# Frozone Meeting 10/28/2025 (in person).

## The budget

Details:
* Frozone instance (BH says approximately $300)
* Web search API (Tabule) no more than $100, GM promises
* Vertex AI API ($400 only once we have a final fine-tuning training set)
    * maybe an additional $400
    * fine-tuning
    * deployment

Verdict: we're under budget, but not super comfortably so. We can't waste
resources with no worries.
