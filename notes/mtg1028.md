# Frozone Meeting 10/28/2025 (in person).

(Holdover items from previous meetings)

## Additional prompt items

1. Don't let it get it too distracted on superficial toxicity rather than the
   deep one.
1. Tell it how to respond if it gets found out.
1. Hey, bot, stay on topic. (don't get wrapped up in Trump 2020 or whatever)
1. Keep your response size small.
1. BH tried to say "make sure it's a central part of the argument before you
   jump in" and "make sure you know it's not a joke", but it didn't seem to
   honor that.

## Process

* Do we want a "SD is maintainer and others submit PR's" culture, or a
  "everybody has push permissions to the main branch" culture?


## Zotero "happy chaos"

Let's start doing some more organizing. (Reminder: items can and should
sometimes be in multiple collections.)

* Type of result
    * datasets (e.g., toxicity/Poudhar 2024)
    * models (e.g., toxicity/Caselli 2021)
    * user studies (e.g., toxicity/Hangartner 2021)
    * applications (e.g., tools/Argyle 2023)

* trim some things we've discovered are far afield?

* ...?

* Do we like a separate `datasets.md` file, or should this information just be
  in Zotero?
