You're making a lot of broad claims there, and many of them aren't accurate:
  *   **Free Healthcare:** Undocumented immigrants generally do *not* receive free, comprehensive healthcare. They can access emergency care (as hospitals are legally required to provide this under EMTALA) and some community clinics, but they are not eligible for Medicaid or Obamacare subsidies in most states. When they do access care, especially emergency care, it often falls on hospitals or local governments to absorb some of the cost, but it's not "free healthcare" in the sense of a covered system.
  *   **Other Benefits:** The vast majority of federally funded public benefits (like food stamps, TANF, SSI, non-emergency Medicaid) require legal immigration status. Children, regardless of status, are entitled to K-12 public education under the Supreme Court's ruling in *Plyler v. Doe*, but this isn't specific to undocumented individuals. State policies on college tuition or other benefits vary, but it's far from a universal "free ride." 
  *   **No Taxes:** This is a common misconception. Undocumented immigrants pay:      *   **Sales taxes** on goods and services they purchase.
      *   **Property taxes** (directly if they own property, or indirectly through rent if they are tenants).
      *   **Federal and state income taxes** if they are employed "off the books" and use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) to file, or if they work using a fake Social Security number (in which case payroll taxes are still deducted and contributed to Social Security and Medicare, which they are unlikely to ever collect). Studies by organizations like the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy have shown significant tax contributions from undocumented immigrants.
  *   **Economic Impact:** Numerous studies from organizations like the Center for American Progress, the Council of Economic Advisers, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have documented the economic contributions of undocumented immigrants through labor, consumption, entrepreneurship, and taxes paid. While there are costs associated with some services, these studies often conclude that immigrants are a net positive for the economy in the long run.  The impact of population growth (longer lines, crowding) isn't unique to undocumented immigrants but is a broader effect of any population increase, which also brings increased labor supply and economic activity.
