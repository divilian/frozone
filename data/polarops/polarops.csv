h15poei,False,">I honestly don't have an issue with this.  We often look for additional ways to punish prisoners and write it off as though they deserve whatever bad treatment they receive.  This just results in worse prison conditions and higher rates of recidivism.  The vast majority of people in prison are not abusing this system, they are using it to just get by and get things most people would consider as essentials.  \n\nThe article mentions 20 prisoners out of 129,000 that have large amounts.  That's about .015 percent, no i don't think this is a large or pressing issue.\n\nThe Justice department and BOP have different goals, I'm glad that the BOP is focused on their goal in this situation and not that of the Justice Dept. because that's how it should be.\n	>I see an issue in edge cases and feel a more moderate approach might be in order such as:\n	\n	* Cap on the amount of money that can be used in these accounts\n	* allowing these accounts to be scrutinized for fraudulent activity without exposing them to court orders. \n	* Adding restriction to the amount of money that can be repaid out of these accounts while the person is in jail.\n	\n	I'm not worried about them but feel if it can be abused maybe we should have a bit more restrictions on them without an additional burden on the prisoner.\n		>It sounds more like there are a few exceptional cases and trying to find a solution for those few cases by painting it as a larger issue than it is.  Court orders already exist and are a valid way to enforce the judgements against prisoners.\n		\n		>cap on the amount of money that can be used in these accounts\n		\n		If this is the only account the prisoners can regularly access and control, why should there be a cap?  It comes across as punishing a prisoner because they have too much money before they were sent to prison?\n		\n		>allowing these accounts to be scrutinized for fraudulent activity without exposing them to court orders.\n		\n		Sound like justifying violating the 4th amendment because the person is in prison.  They are already greatly limited in exercising their rights, but that doesn't excuse further abuses without a valid need when they are able to obtain a court order if needed.\n		\n		>Adding restriction to the amount of money that can be repaid out of these accounts while the person is in jail.\n		\n		There's already limits on how much they can spend from these accounts.  Why more restrictions?  What is the problem that we are trying to solve here?\n			>Prisoners get shaken down and have their mail read. Why is looking at their financial activity less intrusive than throwing their mattress on the floor?\n				>Their cells are subject to inspection and searches due to the fact contraband could be physically concealed there.  Mail is inspected to check against smuggling contraband.  \n				\n				These are both safety issues to the prison and of the prisoners, how does their financial activity relate to physical safety?\n			>>If this is the only account the prisoners can regularly access and control, why should there be a cap?  It comes across as punishing a prisoner because they have too much money before they were sent to prison?\n			\n			Well, if the accounts are shielded from things like child support or alimony orders, they could be an effective way to hide money and keep it from people legally entitled to it.\n				>Court orders are exist for this and are an effective tool.\n					>>	Federal prison inmates are keeping large sums of money — in some cases more than $100,000 each — in government-run deposit accounts effectively shielded from court orders for things like child support, alimony or other debts, and not subject to the same scrutiny as accounts owned by non-incarcerated citizens, according to court documents and interviews.\n					\n					Literally the first paragraph of the article.\n"
h15fsuz,False,">This is like a couple dozen dollars per prisoner on average right?\n\nFeels like a lot of money but there's also a lot of people in prison in the USA.\n	>No solid data is known about the average. Here is relevant information based on the story.\n	\n	>Within the Federal Bureau of Prisons system, which houses roughly 129,000 inmates in facilities throughout the United States, there are more than 20 inmate accounts holding more than $100,000 each for a total exceeding $3 million, a person familiar with the program told The Washington Post.\n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>Sometimes the sources are known, such as inmates cashing out their 401(k) retirement accounts or receiving payments from insurance policies. In other cases, it is less clear how the prisoner has amassed such funds. \n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>According to the individual familiar with the program, one of the biggest account holders is a disgraced former doctor with more than $250,000, while a former member of the military serving a life sentence for murder has more than $200,000.\n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>Most prisoner accounts have only small sums of money.\n	\n	&#x200B;\n	\n	>Inmates can buy snacks and other goods in a prison's commissary, but may not spend more than $360 a month there. Prisoners can also pay to make a limited number of phone calls or send a limited number of emails, though some of the restrictions have been eased during the coronavirus pandemic. And prisoners can send up to $100 a day to other people or have the government issue U.S. Treasury checks for any amount from their prison accounts.\n"
h159h8b,False,">Federal prison inmates do have a unique loophole. They can keep money in government-run deposit accounts effectively shielded from court orders (child support, alimony, debts).\n\nThese accounts are not subject to criminal or regulatory scrutiny that could flag suspicious activity report because the agency is not considered a financial institution and does not run its bank transactions through a treasury department screening program.\n\nThe department of corrections says they have an [Inmate Financial Responsibility Program](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/BOP/e0023/intro.htm) that cannot force inmates to comply with state court orders but will incentivize them to do through privileges. The loophole in the Bureau of Prisons' policy is that they only accept federal court orders and not states.\n\nIn some cases, inmates were released from prison while the Justice Department was still trying to collect money. The Bureau of Prisons gave them debit cards with their account balances on them. The marshals had to track down the men to get their government-issued bank cards.\n\nA Tennessee bank robber asked a federal judge to order the $16,000 he owed in restitution to be taken from his prison account. A Bureau of Prisons staffer urged him not to pay the entire sum -- but rather to pay on a schedule of $100 a month (he would have paid off half of what was owed when he served his time)\n\nCongress has enacted a law that requires inmates to pay what they owe, but the Bureau of Prisons doesn't enforce that without specific court orders.\n\n*What is your thought about this type of arrangement?*\n\nIf you're **against it,** Why shouldn't inmates have money that they can spend for commentary, phone calls, etc. that would be protected from court orders?\n\nIf you're **for it**, Could a system like this be abused or even used as a bribery system for wealthy inmates?\n\n**On the fence**, what type of reform should we apply to this system?\n	>This seems kinda like a non-issue if the wealthiest prisoners (around 20) only have about 100K in their account. The issue with not protecting the little money they do have is in most prisons, prisoners are required to pay for a lot of their goods. If the state was allowed to zero out their accounts then they'd have no recourse because they wouldn't be able to afford an attorney and they'd have no money to buy the goods they need.\n		>We agree that zeroing out their account is not something that should be done. That said, making this limitless system limited might allow a person to put money into a protected account while having excess money allow that be collectible. \n		\n		Doing away with excessive finds would be something I would be for but allowing sheltered bank accounts sounds like it could be ripe for abuse as well if you have enough money.\n			>Ripe for abuse is a non-concern when there are so many existing financial loopholes and non-compliance issues in use by people shielding much more than these 20 people's three million dollars.\n			\n			If we can use this as an excuse to get people with a hard-on for punitive justice on board to implement broad financial and tax reform in a way where actual loop holes and abuses are addressed, then I'm fine with this as rhetoric.\n			\n			Pretending it's a relevant existing issue that demands attention on its own is pretty silly though,  given those numbers.\n	>I think, as a side comment, there's an argument for shielding prisoners from financial collections while they're in custody, and sometime after. \n	\n	If the goal is rehabilitation, that cannot occur if someone is broke when they get out. Desperation is a motivation for some, but not all crimes - and while it's no excuse, I would think that the social benefits of lower recidivism can outweigh the costs. \n	\n	I think of it similar to how collecting back rent from tenants is inherently difficult - the alternative is forcing people into homelessness, which has significantly higher societal costs.\n	>The article specifically references a Megan Bailey, in prison in Missouri on methamphetamine charges.\n	\n	I searches Missouri's court records, and found only Marijuana charges (and traffic violations) under that name. However, per the article:\n	\n	> Megan Bailey, a convicted methamphetamine dealer in Missouri, who was ordered to pay $250,000 as part of a 17-year prison sentence she received in 2019.\n	\n	It's possible Bailey was a drug 'kingpin', peddling large quantities and making large sums in the process. If that were the case, I'd expect to see at least local news articles. None such articles exist.\n	\n	What this tells me is this is *probably* (though not definitely) an excessively large fine for a relatively small crime. I can't know for sure. Dealers typically make [~24,000 per year](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-07-11-9002260581-story.html) so the fine at least feels excessive.\n	\n	In situations like that one, allowing the state to take what little money she does have all but guarantees recidivism.\n	\n	So, even though the system could be (and most certainly is being) abused, until we take efforts to clean up the existing sentencing and fines structures, I have a hard time being angry about it.\n		>Be cautious using the lack of data as proof of anything other than you cannot find the data. I believe federal records are via PACER and not state websites as we are talking about a federal crime. (I'm not for sure.. if a Redditor with more info can reply to this comment that would be great)\n		\n		According to a website, I will not name (as it has her inmate number). Megan Bailey was incarcerated for Conspiracy to distribute Meth, Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Crime.\n		\n		While you're describing a separate problem (excessive fines) something we both agree and it is tangibly related. But the lack of regulation could have issues beyond excessive finds.  It also might be an invitation to use the money to bribe guards given the lack of safeguards on the money.\n			>250k is an absurd fine for distributing meth and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug crime.\n			\n			What did locking up Megan Bailey accomplish? There's still meth on the streets, it's extremely easy to get and very cheap. We've been locking up drug dealers under brutally harsh sentences for decades now and none of this has changed. \n			\n			The drug war is pointless cruelty.\n		>>What this tells me is this is probably (though not definitely) an excessively large fine for a relatively small crime. I can't know for sure.\n		\n		What tells me this is probably *not* a relatively small crime is twofold:\n		\n		a) It's a federal incarceration and feds don't give a shit about low level street dealers that make minimum wage.\n		\n		b) The length of the sentence.  Federal sentencing is pretty straight forward - crimes are assigned base levels and there are modifiers that can add or subtract levels. Add up all the levels for all the crimes and you get a sentencing range.\n		\n		Receiving a 17 year sentence puts her between [levels 30 and 35](https://guidelines.ussc.gov/chapters/5/parts/A/sections) on the sentencing table depending on criminal history and other variables. To put that in perspective, there are only 43 levels total and the crime of trafficking methamphetamine of 12-30 **pounds** is a [level 34.](https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines/2018-guidelines-manual/2018-chapter-2-d)\n		\n		It probably wasn't just that and there were additional crimes like firearm possession.  But it's just not the case that this was your friendly dealer that lives down the hall at your dorm.\n			>[Apparently the median base level offense is a 32](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/quick-facts/Methamphetamine_FY16.pdf) - which implies this person was at or near the median, plus the known possession of a firearm (+2). [Based on this](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-ut/legacy/2013/06/03/fedfacts%20for%20utah_web.pdf) the fine could be related to:\n			\n			> Unlawful for any person to place an advertisement in any newspaper,\n			magazine, handbill **or other publications** seeking or offering to illegally\n			receive, buy, or distribute any Schedule I controlled substance.\n			\n			Which carries a $250,000 fine. If I use an at-home printer to make an advert, and staple it to an electric pole - $250,000 fine.\n			\n			Hell, a business card could mean a $250,000 fine.\n				>>The median base offense level in these cases was 32. This corresponds to a quantity of drugs between 3.3 and 11.0 pounds of methamphetamine.\n				\n				Again, not a small crime.\n				\n				I find it pretty unlikely though that a drug trafficker at the level of moving pounds of meth was printing out advertisements at Office Depot and stapling them to telephone poles around the neighborhood.\n				\n				The reality is we have no idea why the fine was imposed, but the maximum fine for methamphetamine trafficking *by itself* is [$10 million.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30722.pdf)..  so Occam's Razor suggests it could simply have been for that.\n					>Per [this source](https://theconversation.com/most-us-drug-arrests-involve-a-gram-or-less-118440) using data from UC Davis Law Review, ~25% have more than 5 grams.\n					\n					These two aren't reconcilable. It cannot be the case that the median is < 5 grams and carries the penalty of ~7 lbs *unless* the median is skewed by non-drug-mass related characteristics.\n					\n					What those are is hard to tell, but the assertion that she was carrying 3.3 to 11 *pounds* doesn't comport with the statistics we have.\n						>The error you're making is conflating federal drug prosecutions with all state and local drug prosecutions.\n"
h13bl5i,False,">What is it with these blue states in New England, electing moderate red governors? IIRC, there was a post here recently about the Republican governor of Vermont. That's my biggest unanswered question in this article.\n\nIn theory, it has the potential to prevent the state GOP from drifting too far to the right. Living in a red state where the state party often threatens to tar and feather the governor of its own party for not being Trumpy enough, I don't know that it will work that way.\n	>Part of it has to do with open primaries. Something like 70% of massachusetts voters are registered as independent. Often people will vote for the candidate that they see as less bad of the opposition so it encourages more moderate candidates at the state level. Also there isn't the massive ideological divide in Massachusetts that there is in the rest of the country. Fiscally moderate and socially liberal describes a lot of people here. Also the fact that the largest religion group in mass Catholics tend to vote Democrat eats away at the support for a more socially conservative candidate. The state GOP as an organization might be behind Trump but there are enough moderates and liberals here that nominating a candidate that openly espouses Trump's views would hand the election to even the most boring democratic candidate\n	>I think it's more the other direction. Democrats have the run of our legislature, so people like to vote for Republicans in the Governorship to keep them in check. We don't really care much about the state GOP here, they're kind of a joke. Lyons is nuts if he thinks going full Trump is going to help them though.\n		>I mean it's unfair to characterize him as a moderate republican. He's really a moderate Democrat with an R next to his name. This article almost reads like the onion. 'The GOP should take advice from the rights most liked politician by leftists'.\n		>Not exactly. The MA Democratic is not exactly known for being progressive; a lot of progressives and leftists have called out the party for being a corrupt establishment party that's interested in self-preservation. One only needs to look at the dirty tricks employed against Alex Morse to see how corrupt the state party is. \n		\n		https://newrepublic.com/article/161406/charlie-baker-massachusetts-democratic-party-failure\n			>Oh yeah, part of the reason is that informed voters don't trust the party for unilateral rule. The progressive thing is just what I hear as a reason that people say they voted R for Gov. Much of our more progressive stuff has come out of referendums and pressure from the public.\n	>They elect Republican governors because they balance the worse impulses of the Supra-majority legislatures.\n	>Is it really that unique?  \n	\n	While often blue, places like California, Massachusetts, Baltimore, Vermont, and New York have had Republican governors in relatively recent history.\n		>These guys wouldn't even be Republicans in, like, North Carolina.\n		>Ah yes, the good old state of Baltimore\n	>You'll get a lot of the 'balance' theories in response to that, but this implies and intentionality that I don't agree is there. The bottom line is that most of these 'blue states' aren't actually blue.\n	\n	For example, with Massachusetts, you can see [here](https://www.wbur.org/news/2018/03/19/massachusetts-past-election-results) that the state is split about 2:1 Democrat vs Republican, but there are many towns that lean Republican, not Democrat.\n	\n	So in an environment where 1 out of every 3 voters are Republican to begin with, it only takes a few other factors to tip an election. Those factors could be (note that I don't know if these are true, but they seem to match the data):\n	\n	* Republicans tend to be older and thus more of them vote.\n	* Conservative Democrats are often turned off by the candidates that Democrats in that state nominate.\n	* The state has had a string of Republican governors that were widely respected, endorsing each other on the way out.\n	* The Republican party has focused its support on that race\n	* As speculated elsewhere in this post, people could prefer someone as executive that balances out the super-majority of Democrats in other branches.\n	\n	If any two of these are true it could be enough to push the race over the edge, but if I had to guess, I'd be willing to bet that most of them are true.\n		>> there are many towns that lean Republican, not Democrat.\n		\n		The smaller ones do, and not very many.  On your list, the most populous district that leans red is Billerica at something like 30th place, population-wise.  Next one is Westfield, another 10 places down.  You can expect the smallest towns to vote conservative, but not many people live there.\n	>It's the people. They have an identity crisis. Have you been to Boston? Everyone is staunchly liberal but ridiculously conservative. They will preach about the good of homeless shelters but make sure to block any attempts to build one within 10 miles of them. They will promote racial equality but then only hire white people. They actually worked for years to shut down the only gay nightclub in Boston until they finally did it. However, then they are happy to march in a gay pride festival.\n	>The republican governor in Vermont implemented a race based (minority) vaccine schedule, and the called anyone who argues against it racist.\n"
h13105s,False,">Posting this because Charlie Baker is an interesting case. He's a dying breed of northern liberal Republicans that have been leaving the GOP for ages, much like how traditional southern Democrats worked. Tbh these days he could easily pass for a more right wing Democrat.\n\nBut another thing that caught my eye was the increasingly Trumpification of state GOP organisations. They're very intent about influencing the direction of the state GOPs even at the cost of losing power.\n	>Yea Baker is one of the few republicans that would have any shot of winning in Massachusetts. As a resident of the state most people I talk to either like the guy or are ambivalent. There are definitely those who are open to fiscal conservatives amongst the younger generation as balancing the budget is a generally popular proposal. However anyone more socially to the right wouldn't have a path to state office. There does seem to be this almost libertarian bent around here no matter which side of the aisle you are on with a distrust of the power of the federal government in general. This state will elect whoever promises to pass a balanced budget and changes the status quo the least.\n		>> Yea Baker is one of the few republicans that would have any shot of winning in Massachusetts.\n		\n		The article says that Mass. has been electing Republicans governors regularly for the last sixty years\n			>That's fair I should be probably said in this current political climate. I don't think anyone that is riding the current wave of trump populism would not have a shot in this state for instance. The man in your tag Ike would still be able to win in Massachusetts for example. But it requires a very moderate republican by today's standards to carry the state. Any hint of right of center social views generally loses you the election before it starts. Republicans win here by staying away from social issues entirely and promising to balance the budget and promote the states rights over the federal government. All of them have been generally popular here too with the exception of Romney at the end when he decided to spend the 2nd half of his term campaigning for president and handing the Democrats the seat on beacon hill.\n			>West Virginia had been electing Democratic governors regularly for the last several decades too but that doesn't mean Democrats really stood a good shot in 2020 or will in 2024. These sorts of idiosyncratic offices have a way of catching up to a state's partisan lean suddenly and strongly.\n			>Mitt Romney was also governor of Mass and the GOP would claim they never liked him if they could even though he ran for President as Republican. Not much room for moderate Republicans anymore.\n			>Not just regularly, out of the past six governors going back to the early 90's, five were Republican. Most people don't want to go back to the Taxsachusetts days, so they continue voting for Republican governors.\n	>> He's a dying breed of northern liberal Republicans that have been leaving the GOP for ages, much like how traditional southern Democrats worked. Tbh these days he could easily pass for a more right wing Democrat.\n	\n	Right wing democrats are also dwindling. Little that remains are perpetually hounded by activists, journalists and their fellow elected officials. \n	\n	IMO, at state and local level, people will go back to voting for other parties. It is much easier to recognize the incompetence and corruption  at local level than at federal level.\n	>While the GOP is ahead in the race to the extremes, the Democrats are quietly moving as well.\n	\n	https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/four-democratic-incumbents-one-republican-ousted-in-virginia-house-primaries/ar-AAKQxCo?ocid=spartanntp\n	\n	If you notice, all the upsets went to extremists on both sides.  The GOP ones went to trump alignments, while the democrat incumbents were ousted by extreme left positions.\n	\n	\n	I'm not here to argue which is worse.  Only that if both sides continually move farther and farther away from each other, this situation we are in is only going to get worse.\n"

gb7d2fz,False,">Some of us are 'never Trumpers' because we're *not* conservatives per se... or even Republicans. I would encourage those contemplating the future of the GOP to remember that once their party spanned a wide spectrum of membership, including conservatives, moderates, and liberals. The 'moderate middle' is being ignored by both parties right now, but we're here for the taking if anyone will dare attempt to represent us.\n\nI *would consider* voting Republican if they went back to being values- rather than personality-based. And I will be even more likely to vote Republican if they put forward a candidate that is relatively moderate rather than a conservative purist. All of which I very much hope they do should this result be confirmed and Trump not be re-elected. But better a conservative with principles than a demagogue.\n	>Never Trumper is the slang phrase for specially anti Trump conservatives. It doesn't just refer to anyone who is opposed to Trump.\n		>Got it. I guess I aligned myself with it because I had tended to vote Republican but was horrified by Trump. But I did not consider myself a Republican or a conservative. Just more right of center than left of center.\n	>*Technically* (nitpick alert) the NeverTrump was a moniker assigned specifically to conservative detractors. :)\n	\n	It is always intriguing to remember there are centrists who can swing either way. I personally love conservative purism, though I recognize it can make someone unelectable. But I've always carried the conviction that conservatism helps the poor economically, despite everyone saying we're just here to make money.\n		>Yes, we're still around :-) I wanted a non-Trump candidate to consider from the GOP so I threw in with the NeverTrump cause.

Fact: more people AND businesses leave California each year due to overregulation, high taxes, high cost of living, superficial Hollywood newcomers, overcrowding, my God, there must be much more! I'm sorry it wasn't contained in California, the disease has spread certainly and regrettably to Washington state, Oregon and Colorado. It has spread to most other states as well. It was clearly done - it seems like certain companies that attract a certain type of people decided to set up camp in the most densely populated cities thus infecting most large cities. The infection also emanates from schools of all grades through university. The talk was BIG: The media was bought, all 6 major companies organized through ProPublica to coordinate local, regional and national news sources. Corporate was bought to push the agenda through policy in ads, social media, employees. Polls were bought to see the real results and relay false results.\n	\n	The talk was so BIG it fooled the average sheep. \n	\n	\n	We later learned that whole branches of government AND government agencies had failed to protect our checks and balances as hours and hours of testimony and physical hard evidence of voting and election fraud were collected and made public. The media with 95% control of all media withheld the information. Luckily some trickled through.\n	\n	Biden campaigned the least of any political candidate in the history of the United States. Pulled the least number of supporters to rallies (and video views for covid paranoids). The rap sheet for the crime, the motive, lack of sincerity and admission of guilt on video uttered by his own mouth + Time Magazine's own admission show that the guy cheated and did not win lawfully. The Supreme Court was supposed to hear the court cases even if to still deny the doubt of election integrity. Were they bribed? threatened? Or worse? Was it to prevent a civil war? Shut the BLM and Antifa up? To protect the citizens? Are lives more important? What did the veterans of all prior wars die for then? To allow socialism, tyranny, communism? To allow hundreds if not thousands kill themselves with this endless present? Alcohol, suicide, extreme poverty, depression, isolation. Not allowed to socialize? Congregate for religion? Kids developing social anxiety? and not learning in school anymore? Learning Marxism? Learning to hate their country? That they are racist before they even know what that is?\n	\n	Truth is all we got. We have been fighting the communist war since March 2020. Biological warfare resulting in a healthcare state. The medical field is plagued by parties holding a stake in the money made. Workers are deluding themselves about how it really is - they went through the schooling and depend on their job to live. Others are making a pretty penny off incentives to diagnose covid positive. Insurance billing, supplies, pharma, hospitals, doctors. How much did you pay for a rapid test before your flight to Boston where they say you must pass the test before your flight - some paid $400!!!! BTW - no one checks for it!!!! Yes, no one asked for it! Gotcha!!! And only 1 WHOLE YEAR later, they just decided they got too many false positives and turned the PCR thermocycler cycles down. Magically! The number of cases are down! BTW we got reports early on that they constantly had false positives. Yes, too many bad apples were bought and paid for, killed or somehow silenced to not speak the truth.\n	\n	The average sheep bought the whole BS To cheat the election using all means used in the past (exemplified and perfected in California and New York) and using as many mail in ballots as physically needed. The people today had more information than at anytime in the past. Many played stupid and all suffered the consequences. This is a lesson for Libertarians. You can't just let the government run itself and expect it to not get out of control at some point. It's gone WAY WAY haywire!\n	\n	I'm sorry my friend!

You're watching the greatest sting operation in history unfold before our eyes. This wasn't just another 4 year election, it was about dismantling/exposing the establishments entire corrupt system. The people had to see it for themselves and Trump had to be out of the spotlight. And no, it's not going to be handed to Trump once fraud is undeniably proven. The entire government will be incapacitated and the states will hold a new, completely transparent election on paper ballots with mandated voter ID. And those who claim no constitutional way?

The 'they took our jobs' republicans. Then there is the 'elite' republicans . These are the rich republicans that make the rules. These are the business owners, large farmers, politicians, and Donald Trump. \n\nSilently the democrats and republicans agree on immigration. Without illegal immigrants our farm work, manufacturing and butcher plants would struggle to find workers. These workers usually provide SSNs and provide billions to social security every year. They help the economy and keep building materials and food costs low. They are a very important part of the United States, hell I hate to type this but you could call them the modern day slave,\n\nBut but then why is trump building the wall!? That's for votes. The pissed off republicans love that. It doesn't matter if he actually builds it or just fixes sections. His supporters love it and it gets votes. \n\nCrazy California wants to give healthcare to illegal immigrants! California is mostly farmland. Illegal immigrants are very important to the economy of the largest state. It's a gray area but you need them to work. The liberal politicians realize they are people too and they want to treat them like people without coming out and blatantly saying this. It goes back to the modern day slave theory.. it can never be admitted but let's call it for what it is.\n\nAre your kids going to pick apples as an after school job? Probably not. \n\nStill pissed off? Break the system. Go take the jobs that these immigrants occupy. When you say no way... ask yourself why.\n"
frewoyo,False,">Illegal immigration isn't so bad. It's just ignorance or work and play. What I mean by that is that most just work and play.

They disenfranchise felons, they have very difficult voter ID requirements, and they tend to move polling places with no notice.\n		\n		Dems still won tonight despite all that.\n		\n		This is what bothers me about the voter suppression discourse. Voter suppression makes it hard to vote, but not impossible. It's still wrong and I would love to see manor voting reforms passed. But if we don't, it's not the end of democracy. We simply have to work harder to get out the vote.\n			>The voter suppression in upcoming bills is bad, but it's not what's leading to the apocalyptic speech in people who are really looking into it.\n			\n			It's the changes in law like GA and AZ have done so far, with other states like TX following, that take the electoral process out of the Secretary of State's hands and into partisan actors, like either the batshit legislature in GA, or the batshit AG in AZ.  In AZ, they timed the legislation to end when the current Dem SoS's term is over; it's blatant.\n			\n			Beyond that, the gerrymandering in the pipeline will likely give the House to GOP, and it's pretty clear that they won't certify the next President unless they are a Republican.\n			\n			The suppression is bad, but the groundwork being laid for outright fuckery combined with an apparently clear willingness to use it is what's scaring the shit out of us.\n				>Jamey, is that you?\n				>You're right. SoS can just deny Democrat winners of elections. Democracy is dead and we are now as a nation under one facist party rule for the rest of my miserable life.\n					>So this is an idea that's become popular lately. But it isn't true.\n					\n					The legal precedent is clear as day: you can't just ignore the results of an election and seat whoever you like. That's been made abundantly clear over more than two centuries of law.\n					\n					And yes, I'm aware of all the Trump-appointed judges, and the state of the Supreme Court. Remember when they refused to even hear Trump's arguments in November and December? And Trump is their king, more important than any other Republican! It's not as simple as 'we're just going to overturn the election', and never was. If it was ever going to happen, it would for Trump.\n					\n					Now, there's a way Trump or someone similarly awful could win again. It requires no new laws, no brilliant maneuvers, or anything. Here it is: **convince enough people there's no point, then watch them not vote while his base come out to the polls**. That's what worries me, not fantasy scenarios about throwing out elections.\n					\n					Since 2020, Dems have done a lot of winning at the local and state levels. Just last week, they over performed Biden in a race for Congress that the GOP would have loved to win. Last night, they overperformed Biden in a State House race in New Hampshire - despite a bunch if outside spending. (And by the way, NH is under total Republican control at the state level, but they don't seem poised to throw out the result in a race they could've won).\n					\n					Online it looks dark and gloomy. Out in the real world, amazing things are happening. I hope you'll come check it out.\n					>I think doomer points of view like this are actually a form of voter suppression and, whatever your intention is, discourages involvement. \n					\n					If we're just stuck in a fascist tailspin, why even do anything?

He is an impressive, dare I say, kid.\n	>Not long enough, apparently.\n	\n	I'd let him finish growing up before celebrating him; he's already been through full grift cycles. Became famous for alleging that Obama had blocked him on Twitter but it turned out he was lying. Was hired as Ted Cruz' youth director out of that. Turned himself into a consultant and scammed a bunch of money out of other young Republicans that wanted a national voice like he had, doing virtually nothing to help them but taking their money anyway. When that came out, he was fired. Then he dropped out of Republican circles and went to work for Bernie Sanders as a youth person. Dunno what happened there, but now he's back as a Republican activist. \n	\n	Kid's young, so I'm not going to hold ancient behavior against him for forever, I just think he's still young enough that his history warrants a bit of caution.\n		>Wow, I wasn't aware of that at all.

Of course he questioned what he was doing!   \n		\n		\n		And let's be honest, what 13 year old, even in politics, doesn't find Bernie Sanders fascinating. The dude has great promises and makes it sound like he can usher in a prosperous future. Of course he was drawn to that.

Think of all the liberals around them. School, media, video games, and friends. The fact that he dabbled in another ideology, let alone a super popular one at the time, is not unheard of at all. In the past 3 years, he has been a good voice for Republicans.  \n		\n		One more thing, he did indeed do everything you said, but I tell you what, all those things are very huge characteristics of a politician. Possibly a good one, but we will see. We all make mistakes, especially as kids. So far, his mistakes are very forgivable and can be chalked up to learning experiences.

Money talks. He clearly knows that. It's a lot tougher to be certain of his political convictions when he's not been consistent through obscurity or difficulty.\n			\n			Maybe he will be consistently conservative the rest of his life. Only time will tell— and that's all I'm saying. Don't celebrate him yet. Be cautious. If he's still consistent in five years, then I'll be much more willing to count his young missteps as just that.\n	>He's way too grown to be called a kid...

The idea that 'non-whites' don't speak on issues is not true. It seems that the only time you want to hear their voice is when it's convenient to your political beliefs. Also, the idea that we are turning into 'Soviet Union' is nothing but a scare tactic. Are bread lines forming at supermarkets? Unemployment benefits are close to expire if they haven't already, workers are having more flexibility to decide how they want their work place to be. This tactic is always used when Democrats are in power and nothing happens. The same issues that happened under Trump are happening under Biden, not only that but state and local governments are mostly thriving, aside from some areas of course, but the idea that we are turning into a communist country is far fetched at best.\n	>So we were engaged in a world war that went pretty disastrously for us, leaving our economy in shambles.

h155ab6,False,">Banning a theory we don't like is exactly what the left does. It's one thing to say this theory is so extreme it can't be taught in K-12, which is focused on giving minors a basic education. It's another thing to advocate banning it on college campuses. College should be about the open exchange of ideas and rather than advocate banning it, Pearson should learn it and challenge it head on in debate.\n	>By this logic, universities should be teaching witchcraft and flat earth theory too.\n	\n	They don't teach those topics because they are obviously wrong, why would we make an exception to CRT?\n		>I think that this is an unfair comparison. No modern day politician believes in witchcraft, but many modern day politicians believe in Critical Race Theory. Even then, if we look at something like pure Communism via the 1850 manifesto, no one believes in that exact document anymore. Everyone who believes in Communist-esque ideology now is a neo-Marxist, neo-Leninist, or some pretty removed form from the original document. I bring this up to mention that people still teach classes on Marx's *Communist Manifesto* even though no one believes in that form of 'government' for lack of a better word.\n		\n		I think that it is fair to ban classes from teaching critical race theory in high schools, as it is a highly politicized topic, difficult to opt out of, very niche regarding much of history, and risks taking too much of a hardline 'this is the way that it happened' as opposed to just making it an idea that some people believe.\n		\n		I do not believe that it should be banned or even left out of from (optional) colleges curriculums however. In college, it is an opt in choice, and students' minds are far less malleable. Also, most people who take a course on critical race theory will be people who will be political scientists or history majors. Teaching highschool students as a whole is very different from teaching just history majors and political scientists, if they choose to listen.\n		\n		To summarize my feelings on the topic, I think that Critical Race Theory is a poor way to look at history, as it does not really allow for solutions. In spite of this, you have to remember when ideas are banned, you create unmoderated, underground groups of radicals. I would rather have the idea be taught at universities in the public eye where discourse can take place, than foster radical groups that promote unadulterated versions of their ideas.\n		>Some universities do teach witchcraft (history of it anyway) and discuss flat earth theory as a theory when discussing history.\n		\n		These were kind of bad examples to your point.  Universities discuss fascism and communism in-depth in many history programs as well, should be ban those?\n		\n		Banning the discussion of a subject or theory from academia just makes it taboo, and could even cause the inverse effect where more people seek it out considering it's now 'forbidden'.\n		\n		All theories should be up for discussion in post-secondary education.  It just shouldn't be taught for the purposes of indoctrination, but rather evaluation of the theory.\n			>Teaching *about* a theory is very different from teaching a theory as being correct.\n				>I agree, I didn't say I wanted CRT taught exactly the way it's being taught, I'm just saying outright banning the subject from even discussion at universities seems like a step too far.\n				\n				Again, banning something rarely gets rid of it, it just drives it underground.\n			>>It just shouldn't be taught for the purposes of indoctrination, but rather evaluation of the theory.\n			\n			Congratulations for contradicting your whole argument and making my argument for me.\n			\n			Do you honestly believe these CRT courses are looking at the topic in an objective, historical comparison? Have you seen any of the reading material or seen any speakers?\n			\n			Honestly, they have it set up brilliantly. They lecture you on how the entire premise of the country is flawed, and anything that goes against that narrative is used as evidence that the narrative exists.\n			\n			If you try to refute the goals of the founders using, idk their letters and articles from the time, then they just accuse you of defending the 'racist' system they founded.\n				>Except schools are teaching it as a serious established theory that you should consider believing yourself. The entire program is to convince you of its merits. Witchcraft classes don't have that approach.\n			>> Universities discuss fascism and communism in-depth in many history programs as well\n			\n			Do they now ? Because most of the college people I've talked with apparently have little to no idea what any of those are.\n				>I can't speak for everyone but when I attended undergraduate my political science classes discussed the differences in ideology quite extensively as well as their similarities.\n				\n				Admittedly it's been about 16 years since I went to Undergrad, and my graduate degree is an MBA, so not much political science there.\n		>We don't need the government to ban the teaching of flat Earth or witchcraft.\n			>That's not really my point.\n			\n			Why aren't universities open to teaching those topics? Shouldn't they teach anything by your logic?\n			\n			Remember, universities are government sustained. You can easily make the argument when a university takes a position on something, they are backed by the government.\n				>Private universities aren't public \n				\n				Colleges already essentially teach whatever they want including about those subjects\n				\n				It's up to the faculty, administration, and students. Not the government. It's academic freedom, something that we should take care not to infringe\n		>No, by that logic universities should be banned from teaching it, which was his point. Universities teach the bible too, which is just as wrong in many places.\n			>Universities teach the history of the bible and deconstruct the ideas behind it. Same thing with Islam.\n			\n			They don't convert the students to those religions in those courses like they do in CRT. In my experience, classes teaching about religion are more likely to promote atheism in the students than a more positive outlook on religion.\n				>Religious universities, which receive federal and state money, do teach it as truth. But you ignored his point, which is that the government shouldn't be involved in banning university curricula.\n		>Okay, I'm very much against CRT. But, I don't like the idea of seeing anything as 'obviously wrong' in an academic setting. Maybe it's my education background in STEM, but much of the innovation we make comes from things we once considered obviously wrong.   \n		\n		\n		There are pros and cons when information is free to be discussed.\n			>Then you've killed the entire purpose of higher education. \n			\n			If our universities, publicly funded by the way, start teaching 2+2=5 because we no longer believe in objective truth, than higher education is worthless.\n			\n			CRT is entirely based on numerous false premises. The idea that the nation's very foundation is racist, is false. The idea that we are nothing more than the average of our intersectional/post-modernist identity groups, is false. The idea that western society is the genesis for all evil in the world right now, is totally false. Honestly, Santa Claus is more believable than CRT.\n				>Don't spend a fucking paragraph explaining why something is bad that I've stated I don't endorse. It's pointless. And, no, not all universities are publicly funded.\n				\n				The ideas of Plank, Bohr, Shrodinger, Einstein, Oppenheimer, etc were all considered obviously wrong and based on incorrect presuppositions. When it turned out that the prevailing presuppositions were wrong. I'm not here defending CRT. I'm here defending the idea that the mainstream 'correct' think is not always right. And, using the 2+2=5 analogy brings a level of irony into this, as an adage to 1984. Freedom is the freedom to say 2+2=4. If that is granted, all else follows.\n				\n				'Right think' is being advocated on both sides and it's not just detrimental, it's downright authoritarian. The antidote to bad ideas isn't banning them. It's challenging them with good ideas. We used to believe this, at one point.\n	>So far I've seen laws, at least in the Oklahoma one, they don't really '' ban it'', they just forbid making it's teaching obligatory. They can still teach this kind of garbage, but they can't force you to take the class, nor they can make your grades depend on it.\n	>Just to gauge where your lines would be; do you feel that should apply to tax-funded public schools, or only privately funded ones? Do you also advocate for the teaching of sexism in universities? Or just racism? Because CRT literally advocates for (actually) institutionalized racism. \n	\n	I totally get your point! That the idea of 'cancelling' ideas we don't like makes us not much better than the unhinged lefties! Consider though, that the idea of suppressing abhorrent and dangerous world views isn't new. We 'cancelled' tf outta Hitler for using CRT to 'other' the Jews. Do we not generally try to eliminate, or *cancel* racism? How would opposing CRT be any different than opposing any *other* form of racism? I'm just trying to figure out if you support the idea of teaching racism in general, or if this one specific form just feels different to you somehow. \n	\n	As easy as the idea of standing idly by allowing evil to thrive sounds, sometimes in life we've gotta stand up for our principles. Assuming we have any. Sometimes good *has* to cancel evil, or we condemn entire future generations to the consequence of our complacency. It's not really the same as trying to ruin someones career and life because they uttered some word 20 years ago that we don't like.\n		>Frankly, I would do away with government education in the first place. There should be a separation of education and state. \n		\n		Having said that, the government did not ban National Socialist ideology. In fact, many progressives thought fascism was great in the 1920's and 1930's. Communists opposed the fascists, until the Hitler-Stalin pact and then fascism was fine. Until the war anyway. After National Socialism had been defeated and the horrors of death camps discovered the government didn't need to ban Nazism or eugenics, these doctrines were naturally abandoned. \n		\n		I would much rather conservatives win the debate on campus than use the power of the state to unjustly banish ideas we don't like.\n	>>	Banning a theory we don't like is exactly what the left does.\n	\n	Like what? Let's hear some examples.\n		>I think that He means to say that the left de-platform those that they disagree with, which is similar, although not exactly the same, as de-platforming an idea. To give an example of that, although I know that you didn't exactly ask for this, Richard Dawkins being de-platformed for his 'offensive' ideas on Islam.\n	>Lots of misunderstanding of the word theory in these discussions. Theory means it's been tested rigorously enough to be accepted by the scientific community. Theory is conflated with hypothesis, which is the untested phase. A theory is all but proven. Evolution is a theory because it's been tested. \n	\n	Flat-Earth is NOT A THEORY. It has no evidence or scientific consensus. \n	\n	CRT, while I don't know much about it, I doubt it is supported enough to be a true theory. \n	\n	If we talk about banning anything, ban calling it a theory and giving it the scientific recognition that comes with that word. \n	\n	It's bad enough people thinking evolution is 'just a theory'.\n		>Theory in a liberal arts context is essentially a tested hypothesis and by tested I mean discussed and accepted by at least some group within the liberal arts world. In the case of CRT, it's been around for awhile now and has been adopted by numerous people as true. The problem is that there has been little to no pushback in academia because conservatives are grotesquely outnumbered and are actively denied admissions into Ph.D programs and tenure tracks. Conservative media is over a decade behind on this issue, CRT has been accepted and pervasive on college campuses and in K-12 for some time now.\n	>It's not an actual 'theory'. It's social engineering.  GFY with that dishonesty.\n	>I think the only problem is you can't debate these topics. There's no really good answer, university is a cesspool.\n		>The answer to that isn't to copy the left and ban theories we don't like.\n			>I agree we shouldn't ban any subject, I just wish professors were mediators instead of indoctrinators.\n				>I wish they would stick to their area of expertise rather than add lefist talking points into each class. Mathematics doesn't require a discussion on race.\n	>Look at what's happening around CRT my dude. \n	\n	Teachers getting fired for being critical of CRT, parents being thrown out of school board meetings, CRT being required without any public input. \n	\n	This isnt about college or the freedom to discuss ideas. This is about mandated propaganda forcefully injected into our country under the cover of the pandemic.\n		>Where is CRT mandatory?\n	>If we aren't teaching racism again black people is cool.....which it is not cool.\n	\n	\n	Than we should be teaching racism against white people is cool....which it is not cool.\n"

h284isa,False,">The first rule of politics is that if you don't win none of your opinions matter.  That's the first thing to understand about why the more traditionally more left wing parties like Labour moved to the centre.  Thatcherism was pretty popular across the English speaking world at the time, and third way politics was considered the best way to adapt to what was popular at the time.  So that necessitated a move to the right and away from more traditional socialist values (that most people in these parties didn't have anyway) in order to get elected.  Which, referring back to rule one, is all that matters in the end.  In Canada the Chretien Liberals (really it was all Paul Martin) inherited a nasty debt and had no choice but to make big spending cuts.  This was actually a ploy by Chretien to hurt his Liberal rival Martin, by making him Finance Minister responsible for unpopular cuts to social programs.  Didn't work really, but that was the idea.\n	>To add to this excellent comment, the Labour Party's manifesto in 1983 was so unpopular and extreme it was dubbed 'the longest suicide note in history', but many in the party prefered maintaining their 'intellectual purity' rather than getting into office and changing laws. \n	\n	Basically people were just tired of losing, and third wayism/triangulation placed the focus of policy of providing what the electorate wanted, rather than what the committed party members did.\n		>>but many in the party prefered maintaining their 'intellectual purity' rather than getting into office and changing laws. \n		\n		This continues to be an issue to this day.\n	>> The first rule of politics is that if you don't win none of your opinions matter.\n	\n	And to put some numbers to this: Democrats had lost three consecutive presidential elections where their opponents had won more than 400 electors.

h284474,False,">Basically, Reaganites. That's why. In the 80s in both the US and the UK, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher had a similar brand of politics that deeply captured a whole generation. Reagan in particular not only DESTROYED his competition, but he also transformed his party and codified the future for modern conservatives. As Reagan turned over to his successors, he left politics but his influence remained. Society as a whole got a whole lot more supportive of extreme emphasis on the private sector and other economically right ideas, and for left of center folks to remain competitive, they had to move right on these issues. Clinton's shift to the right was a matter of self-preservation. Thatcher had a similar effect.\n\nNow, Reaganites are starting to get to be a bit older and their influence is waning as Millennials start to become of voting age. Plus, history hasn't been kind to Reaganite economic ideas, which has helped make these pushes to right seem unfavorable looking back.\n	>I would like to point out that 'Millennials' are mostly in their 30s, with some of us pushing 40. We have to do better to stop conflating millennials with Gen Z...we millennials have been of voting age for quite a while. Unfortunately, we are just unreliable voters, at least here in the States, because both our center-right party, the Democrats, and extremist-right party, the Republicans, are unpalatable and uninspiring because they are extremely out of touch. My generation is the largest voting bloc but the median age of Congress is 60, and with quite a few members pushing 90. It's also difficult for my generation to take over because there's still the GenXers and Xennials and my generation only controls about 2% of all of society's wealth - being that the Boomers are living much longer and refusing to step aside.\n	\n	The lurch into Gerontocracy is one of the most toxic and undiscussed burdens on our society, but that is a discussion for another time. Point is: anyone born after 1996 is not a millennial and saying millennials are coming of voting age is not only wrong, it's kind of derogatory and belittling.\n		>\>I would like to point out that 'Millennials' are mostly in their 30s, with some of us pushing 40.\n		\n		Yes, I know we're now official kinda old people, and kinda old people vote, young people don't. The reason that opinion on Reagan has started to sour so quickly over the last few years is because more 'young' folks are hitting political maturity--early to late 30s. Folks younger than that don't vote reliably enough to be a real bloc that can compete. Gen Z still has 10 years or so before their adults start being a force as a voting bloc.\n		\n		\>Unfortunately, we are just unreliable voters, at least here in the States, because both our center-right party, the Democrats, and extremist-right party, the Republicans, are unpalatable and uninspiring because they are extremely out of touch.\n		\n		I don't agree with this. I think more and more Millennials are coming to a better understanding of politics where they are moving away from that excessively ideological purist view. Millennials are becoming *more* reliable and starting to change the paradigm because they're going out to vote for whichever candidate they *most* like. I think you're describing your experience, but overall Millennials are jumping into the voting population at about the same age and about the same force as previous generations.\n		\n		\>being that the Boomers are living much longer and refusing to step aside.\n		\n		Right. The real issue here is that even when Millennials get involved, they're outnumbered by the Boomers and the Boomers aren't dying or retiring. Which, I get, and they shouldn't be forced to irrelevant themselves...but you're right that these are folks increasingly not invested in the future and are still the most powerful voting bloc and that's a very bad combination for society.\n		\n		So let me be clear: I'm saying millennials are coming of age politically. Most young adults don't get into politics right away. 20 somethings don't vote. Sure, SOME do, but not enough to make a generational stamp on politics. Every time a candidate tries to 'motivate the youth vote' he loses unless he's making a base in a different demographic. The rise of Pete Buttigieg was fueled almost entirely by 30-40 year old moderates and weak progressives--that's millennials. Buttigieg had the second strongest performance of any candidate.\n			>I concur with most of your comment, as a millennial whose voted in every election since I turned 18, my generation are a frustrating bunch - but you're right, my generation is starting to become more politically active, but as a left-wing voter myself (Bernie Sanders is center-left in my view), and one who's heavily involved in left-wing grassroots organizing, most center-lefters and left-wing voters still find both of our parties unpalatable, but the two party system is irredeemable and entrenched, and most of my compatriots aren't becoming less ideologically purist per se, we just know that to stop the extreme-right swing we can't afford to sit out on elections, even though I wish we would've came to our senses 4 years ago.... I vote Democrat but I'm still not a huge fan - though I am pleasantly surprised at Biden's willingness to open the door to progressives and leftists, yet the gerontocracy that is Congress is virtually intransigent for any policy left of hunting the homeless for sport (hyperbole, but you'll get my point).\n			\n			Anyway, more narrowly, my comment was coming from a place of frustration with Millennials not being given the proper respect, and still being thought of as kids. Certainly nothing in my comment is meant to detract from your overall points, most of which I agree with - even if I may not like it. There is one exception, however, in that I think Buttigieg's rise was more fueled by a large sect of Gen Zers, who are notably less left-leaning than my generation. But I haven't looked at the data so this is just conjecture.\n				>\>but as a left-wing voter myself (Bernie Sanders is center-left in my view), and one who's heavily involved in left-wing grassroots organizing, most center-lefters and left-wing voters still find both of our parties unpalatable, but the two party system is irredeemable and entrenched, and most of my compatriots aren't becoming less ideologically purist per se, we just know that to stop the extreme-right swing we can't afford to sit out on elections, even though I wish we would've came to our senses 4 years ago....\n				\n				Two things. One, you happen to ascribe to the most purist part of the Dems and I imagine you surround yourself with a greater than average amount of folks who think similarly. That's not a criticism--most of us attract people like ourselves, which is exactly why anecdotal evidence is so unreliable. So I think you're probably seeing more purity than there actually is, just like it's possible I'm seeing less (though I'd say most of the data support my reading more than yours). \n				\n				Two, even here you're admitting that there is more pragmatism and less purity over time even in your particular group. I'm a millennial that was calling out Sanders folks hard in 2016 for precisely the kind of thinking you're lamenting 4 years ago. I'm by no means saying that millennials are hardcore two party system fans, but I'm saying the same thing you're saying.\n				\n				\>though I am pleasantly surprised at Biden's willingness to open the door to progressives and leftists, yet the gerontocracy that is Congress is virtually intransigent for any policy left of hunting the homeless for sport\n				\n				Yes, this is what myself and other moderates have been saying about Biden ever since the beginning of the primaries and Sanders folks didn't want to hear it...but I digress. I think the issue you're hitting on is less a matter of gentocracy and more a matter of anti-majoritarian features of our system creating gridlock to an extreme degree. Plenty of really old folks are committed to major structural change--in fact, I think you could argue that the modern progressive momentum doesn't exist without Old Man Sanders and Old Bird Warren laying the path. The problem is that change of any kind requires on a level of consensus that is not reasonable to expect in any free society.\n				\n				\>There is one exception, however, in that I think Buttigieg's rise was more fueled by a large sect of Gen Zers, who are notably less left-leaning than my generation. But I haven't looked at the data so this is just conjecture.\n				\n				Yeah, take a look and you'll see that Buttigieg's base was youngish white folks who were mostly moderate but also kinda open to progressive politics. Basically, he cannibalized Warren's base, which is one reason Warren never got off on the right foot. You can see she started to realize this halfway through as in one of the debates she went after Buttigieg HARD and he held his own (I think it was the debate before she eviscerated Bloomberg). Of course, there are ton of millennial voters that were also fueling the Sanders/AOC side of the party. But if anyone was after Gen Z it was Sanders, both in 2016 and 2020, and in both cases he wasn't able to pull through because even though these guys are in their late teens and early 20s, most folks don't politically mature until after that (some vote still, but lots of the time they vote the same as their parents). \n				\n				I, too, get bent out of shape when folks bash on millennials for no reason and still think of us as being kids. Hell, I just had a kid myself! Political maturation just tends to happen well after regular coming of age. That's all I meant.\n"
h28p0it,False,">I'm guessing I'll be in disagreement with most of posters here, as I consider 'paradigm shifts' to be the consequence (rationalization), rather than the motive force of social changes. \n\nBut if I am to rely on my own experience, I can't sum up main reason as anything but 'fall of USSR'.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat you consider 'left-wing' (or economically left) position is centrist (or SocDem), as the whole point of it is to support status quo, even if it means sacrificing interests of one group or the other. Actual Left has alternative to status quo. Centre doesn't.\n\nThe general dynamic that kept Centre in power in most of 20th century was based on sacrificing actual left (socialist) policies to reach an agreement with capitalists (i.e. rich elite; not whatever can be considered 'capitalist' ideologically in US).\n\nBasically, you have some broad coalition (formal or informal, doesn't really matter) of 'united left' that presents some threat to status quo. Centrists then use this 'united left' to negotiate with capitalists, so as to acquire some concessions ('if you don't agree to our demands, bad evil communists might start a revolution or present much harsher demands').\n\nThis was the main drive of First World politics since Weimar republic (at the very least; the same dynamic can be applied to UK Liberal Party pre-WW1 and so on).\n\nHowever, there is a major problem with such a dynamic: if Left movements consistently fail to reach their goals, then people start going straight to centrists (as it is centrists who end up 'doing' actual things), weakening Left in process. But if Left  weakens, then it can't provide strong bargaining position to the Centre: centrists don't have anything to threaten capitalists with. Consequently, centrists have no option but to choose among themselves the most economically radical members to throw them under the bus together with proper socialists.\n\nI.e. the ultimate result of this dynamic is constant shift of political balance to the Right.\n\n* This dynamic doesn't work in the opposite direction as capitalists have a stream of wealth that can be invested into politics to sustain right-wing parties even if said parties never reach their goals.\n\nWhen Soviet Union was around, this shift was somewhat alleviated by its presence: even outside of direct support there was an example of Left politics providing practical results. Hence, there was a certain trickle of people into the Left.\n\nHowever, as Soviets started to weaken, First World Left started to lose ground as well. *Zastoi* period weakened position of centrists to the level that they lost to open Right-wingers (Thatcher and Reagan). Subsequent collapse of USSR (that begun with *Perestroika*) ensured that Left would not regain its power, and that there would be no return to the old compromise: capitalists would not accept it, as they have no reason to fear any revolutions.\n\nAnd this is how the dynamic I described above started to define politics since the 1990s: to get back into power, centrist politicians (ex. Blair) sacrificed economic demands and doubled-down instead on 'social' (as those do not really concern capitalists, while can be presented as some kind of 'achievement' to general population).\n"

The Third Way's success neutered social democrats practically overnight, demonstrating that socialism wasn't necessary to provide many of the platform planks required by Labour, and the services provided won over those who had previously supported  a reduced government footprint. It was a compromise style of governance that appealed to the broad center and reduced the need for the extremes.\n"

I do think they should match the electoral college vote from a state with its popular vote.\n				>Then why not simply eliminate the current governmental structure completely and move to a parliamentary government like most European countries. Our Government was built on the idea that the 'Several States' were in no different than the nations of Europe that formed a Union much like the EU did only much sooner and giving more power to the central government. Part of the reason these states were willing to give so much power to the central government was the limited protections afforded them by the Senate (Each state has an equal say) and the Electoral College (Even small states have some say in who becomes president). Imagine being one of the smaller states, if Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Virginia all agreed a on something they could impose their will upon the other 9. That is what you get if you eliminate the Senate or the Electoral College\n				\n				I do understand many people feel pure democracy is the way it should be but only when they believe they have the most people on their side\n		>Yeah, I agree with the concept of the Senate itself, since, when combined with the House of Representatives, it ensures the Congress is balanced between majority rule (based on population aka the House) and still giving the minority at any given time a voice (in the all-states-get-2-votes Senate). I don't necessarily think that the Senate should be the more powerful body, though. I also don't think the Senate, or anything except the popular vote in each state, should decide what happens with electoral votes.\n			>If the House were allowed to grow with population, this would be a stronger argument, but we would probably need to use the Internet to accomplish that.

Originally the House was supposed to track population, but we stopped it and really we needed to at the time, because of floor space.\n						>This is why I say we don't add members, we redistribute proportionally. 435 is plenty, but you can still modify the amount every state gets within the 435 to be proportional to their population.

More representatives allow greater precision, and with the Internet I don't really see a good reason not to expand the House again.\n							\n							In states with more than one representative, this is less of an issue, although with only two or three I expect there would still be a similar problem.\n		>An anti-Senate centrist? Never thought I'd see that. There's certainly validity to your argument, but the Senate does one thing that the House doesn't, and that's really emphasize ideological difference. The structure of the House makes sense — but all it does is churn out bills at 100 mph. The Senate is simply not meant for that. It's supposed to lend legitimacy to small states by being a deliberative body. For all her positives, Lisa Murkowski can be a thorn in Biden's side on energy issues just because the institution of the Senate recognizes, 'hey, the Alaskan people deserve to have their input considered.' Even if I disagree with Murkowski on that particular issue, it's part of the magic of the Senate that she can rightfully defend her state. One of the reasons I am pro-filibuster even though I do recognize the dangers of not passing legislation. That said, no matter the content, in my book a bill with 60 yeas is better than a bill with 50 yeas. If that attitude doesn't cut it with today's GOP, then DSCC (or at least folks with DSCC connections) is gonna have to do some damn hard work and get involved in Republican primaries in open primary states. Color me firmly in the Manchin camp on the Senate. I just want the other Dems (other than Sinema) who share my beliefs to stand up for them, because I believe in context Manchin has always taken far too much heat.\n"

gwuo5g7,False,">Minnesotan here.  I'm not aware of anything in particular that our government is doing that is very different than any many other states.  What really is different, though, is our preexisting culture.  Whether its due to our Scandinavian roots or some other factor, we are a people that are pretty dedicated to doing right by our neighbors, and civically engaging.  For instance, we've had the highest voter turnout in every election going back as far as I can remember; In 2020 [we nearly hit 80%!](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/voter-turnout-by-state)  I'd really be interested in seeing if there was a correlation between voting rates and vaccine hesitancy, now that we're talking about it...\n	>There could be some correlation between the high voter turnout,  trust in institutions, and low vaccine hesitancy. \n	\n	One thing I'll add is that you should be skeptical of the data because it shows such strong state-line effects. Fargo, ND and Moorhead, MN have a combined MSA and you should expect there to be a much more smooth change in vaccine hesitancy.\n		>> One thing I'll add is that you should be skeptical of the data because it shows such strong state-line effects.\n		\n		That raised my eyebrow too: from [the methodology document](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/265341/vaccine-hesitancy-COVID-19-Methodology.pdf), the underlying data is from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey which is used to estimate state-level vaccine hesitancy rates.  So those should be pretty robust.\n		\n		Then they used demographic data to see how vaccine hesitancy depends on each, and applied those to PUMA- and county-level demographic data.  Which I daresay still leaves the county-level estimates dominated by the state-level estimates, since while e.g. Cass County where Moorhead is has different American Community Survey (ACS) demographics to Minnesota as a whole, they're just not *that* different so you will only tend to get in-state variation as far as the demographics swing from county to county **and** the vaccine hesitancy varies between those demographics.\n		\n		Plus, political leanings are *not* among the demographics available via the ACS, while [there's a pretty strong correlation there.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/17/us/vaccine-hesitancy-politics.html)\n		>I'd like to point out that with regards to the [hhs estimates](https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/vaccine-hesitancy) there are some methodological quirks that make that map and the map [circulating yesterday by the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/health/covid-herd-immunity-vaccine.html) potentially misleading. \n		\n		\n		[The methodology can be found here](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/265341/vaccine-hesitancy-COVID-19-Methodology.pdf). \n		\n		These estimates of vaccine hesitancy were created using a logistic regresssion and used these measures as estimators: age, gender, race, education, marital status, health insurance status, income levels, **state**, with interaction between race and education level. \n		\n		State to me is odd because this gives very defined borders to states. Niaevely I'd assume since this issue has become somewhat polarized with dems (in general) being more likely to get the vaccine that this map should sort of mirror a population map with more dense populations wanting the vaccine with more rural areas not wanting/needing the vaccinee due to proximity. \n		\n		Going back to the variables it's basically MRP without the PUMA-level (Public Use Microdata Areas) effects or any real continuous effects at all. Leading to some really disjointed state lines. Because of the inclusion of state in the predictive model, I'm not even sure if this should be displayed at the county level or just at the state level. Add this to the releativly new and untested pulse data and I'm not sure this is useful at all.\n			>Yeah the model is clearly using state as a major factor in the estimate.

gwvhrq4,False,">What's so special about MN though? VT and CA also have very low rates per your map. Is it just about the fact that MN is surrounded by other states with higher hesitancy rates?

I've never really spent time in MN before, and the contrast at the state border of MN is stark compared to the surrounding Wisconsin, Iowa, and the Dakotas.

I grew up in rural Minnesota, about 15 miles from the Iowa border, and yes, everything was very different when you crossed the border!! The roads, buildings, towns on the Iowa side look different. Everything in iowa looked... Dusty? Or old or something (sorry). Minnesota is a really weird place- we have a distinctive culture that is reflected in how our state governs, educates, everything. Minnesotans have a trust in government that our neighboring states do not. We pay more taxes and we are very aware of it, but we also get better *stuff* because of it. Even rural Republican Minnesotans know that. I think it's the trust issue, as well as a messaging issue.\n		>I guess the rural aspect is interesting because in your map you can see the rural areas remain quite low for hesitancy. Having spent quite a bit of time in MSP area as well as Milwaukee area for work trips, I felt that a lot of the liberal perceptions of MN probably come from how the city is, but I have to admit I'm a bit clueless about the rural regions.\n	>OP attends college in MN and is outsourcing a portion of their homework to reddit?\n		>I am (fortunately? unfortunately??) long past school.\n			>Heh.

I don't know why that is ultimately other than perhaps the DFL in Minnesota was more sympathetic to the needs of farmers in MN than the democratic parties were in neighboring states (that's a straight guess).  So really I suspect a lot of it is because of the seeming tendency for Trump supporting republicans to be hesitant about the vaccine, and people with such a political bent to be more common outside of MN than inside. \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/17/us/vaccine-hesitancy-politics.html\n	>[Minnesota is more urban](https://www.icip.iastate.edu/tables/population/urban-pct-states) and that's a [major political division](https://www.governing.com/now/americas-ever-widening-urban-rural-political-divide.html).\n	\n	It could be very misleading to compare e.g. rural white North Dakotans with urban Black Twin Cities residents by looking at the averages over the entire states.

First, using the HPS, we used a logistic regression to analyze predictors of vaccine hesitancy using the following sociodemographic and geographic\ninformation: age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, health insurance status, household income, state of residence, and interaction terms between race/ethnicity and having a college degree. Second, we applied the regression coefficients from the HPS analysis to the data from the ACS to predict hesitancy rates for each ACS respondent ages 18 and older. We then averaged the predicted values by the appropriate unit of geography, using the ACS survey weights, to develop area-specific estimates of hesitancy rates.\n\nThat aside, here's an interesting piece for you /u/Autoxidation to quantify the cultural claims some made here yesterday.\n\nA [2013 study by Cambridge and U Texas Austin psychology researchers published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-a0034434.pdf) considered the possibiltiy of personality regionality in the United States.

It's simple, you can minimize costs and it's very easy to show you did it without enacting any real change whatsoever.  This is a very attractive prospect to politicians with very low risk.

So this Policy review is from June 18, 2019.**\n\nThe topic is should the prison population have access to air conditioning?\n\nSome at least 13 states (some states have no data on this): Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisianna, Mississippi, Missouri, N. Carolina, S. Caroline, Texa, Virginia lack AC.\n\nWhy is AC needed? Because people who are incarcerated have various health conditions, some that can make dehydration and heat stroke a higher risk. Conditions like high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, or psychotropic medication. This has in the past led to deaths from inadequate cooling.\n\nSome states refuse air conditioning as an appearance to be tough on crime. But Wisconsin, Arizona, Mississippi have already ruled that incarceration in extremely hot or cold temperatures violates the eight amendments.\n\nA few things to ask the community:\n\n* We never hear that prisons don't install heating (I'm from the northern states); why is AC any different?\n* Is the lack of AC against the 8th amendment?\n* Is the lack of AC a crime deterrent?\n* Should the US Prison systems act as a deterrent on crime or a place to rehabilitate, or both?\n	>>Some at least 13 states (some states have no data on this): Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisianna, Mississippi, Missouri, N. Carolina, S. Caroline, Texa, Virginia lack AC.\n	\n	There's some seriously hot states on that list. There's evidence that hotter temperatures lead to violent crime. So having a hot, angry populace with criminal tendencies seems like a terrible situation, for both the inmates and guards.\n	\n	As to why AC is different than heat, it's not seen as essential to life in the same way. I never went to a school that had AC and have lived in homes without it. This is getting rarer, but at the time, I would have been hard pressed to be upset prisoners didn't have AC when I was sweating my own rear end off. It can be expensive to retrofit buildings for it, and spending money on criminals is not popular.\n		>Thanks for your life experiences, I was also very similar to you growing up, it's would be different for a person with high blood pressure, asthma, or diabetes they would be vulnerable to high temperatures. \n		\n		Being cool on an 85-degree day or staying indoors vs a high humidity 105 and above day are too very separate conditions and AC in many contexts feels luxurious but when you are a ward of the state and they can't cancel school for excessive heat or you can't go to the refriedge to crack open a cold drink to cool yourself off experiences can differ especially on days of excessive heat warnings.\n		\n		Excessive heat is my main concern and creating liveable connections for all inmates. I feel our society should treat our lower class with some humanity as well. That was what I tried and believed failed to highlight.\n	>I think focusing on AC while not considering other measures to control temperature and ensure people don't overheat is flawed. I used to be a welder and the Texas summers could be brutal sometimes. But being indoors, out of direct sunlight with adequate airflow made for a pretty easy day. Even when I was in full leathers. Now do these same prisons have adequate airflow? Do they make water available in sufficient quantities? Now if they don't have AC, don't have adequate airflow, and don't make water available in sufficient quantities then that is a violation of the 8th amendment. AC is not required to satisfy the 8th amendment.\n		>At a certain temperature those other means of cooling don't work for instance the CDC doesn't recommend water misters above a heat index of 105. So what about those conditions?\n			>When the heat index is 105 outside, go inside. If they have sufficient airflow and access to water then that should be fine.\n				>There are conditions that will be at a higher risk or death because of heat, because 10 people died I would say that is not adequate advice for all inmates. Would you agree?\n					>Certainly, and inmates with medical conditions that make them prone to heat related issues should probably be moved to facilities that can accommodate those conditions. That is probably a fairly small number of people though.\n						>I don't know what size that at risk population is based on the data provided.\n							>That seems like a requirement to really make a judgement here. Without that data, the question is should AC be a requirement under the 8th amendment for all of the prison population? In my opinion, that answer is no because it is pretty easy to stay cool for individuals that don't have medical conditions that are exacerbated by high temperatures when they are indoors with access to water and adequate airflow.\n	>> Should the US Prison systems act as a deterrent on crime\n	\n	Prison under any conditions acts as a deterrent around [1.24% of the time](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/34351/1/557359392.pdf). If the cruelty of prison is designed as a deterrent, it's doomed to fail. If we proposed other policies similar to prison that would have a 1.24% reduction in their targeted goal, we'd (rightfully) disregard them.\n	\n	Oh, and in the US, [prison has 'on balance, no rehabilitative or deterrent effects after release.'](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0604-8)\n	\n	On the rehabilitation side, what we do [isn't effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3762476/?_escaped_fragment_=po=96.1538). The mere teaching of 'life skills' doesn't (per the prior study) show any capacity for rehabilitation. In fact [our prisons have recidivism up to 20% higher than some of our peer countries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6743246/).\n	\n	So to get back to your question,\n	\n	> Should the US Prison systems act as a deterrent on crime or a place to rehabilitate, or both?\n	\n	It doesn't seem prison *can* have deterrent effects, so we should focus on solving why people commit crime to begin with and combine it with rehabilitation.\n		>Prison's primary benefit is incapacitation, not deterrence or rehabilitation.  Someone in a cell can't commit crimes against the broader public.  \n		\n		So even if we assume that prison is only 1% effective at deterring crimes in advance, it is nearly 100% effective at either (a) stopping crimes or (b) isolating the crimes to the inside of a prison while the criminal is still in jail.\n		>Well, prison is very effective at providing incredibly cheap labor.\n	>The prison system SHOULD BE about rehabilitation, as it claims, but the corporations running them would go out of business if that were true.  \n	\n	Also:  I doubt a lack of AC is a functional deterrent.  I can see criminals gathered, discussing criminal activities, when one says, 'I can handle being in a cage, I can handle getting raped, I can handle people trying to kill me...wait, they don't have AC in prison?  Ok, I'm out.'\n		>The primary purpose of the prison system is incapacitation, not rehabilitation.  We put people in jail so they can't commit more crimes out in society, not because jail is going to fix them.  \n		\n		If the goal was to 'cure' someone's propensity to commit crimes, jail would be a terrible place to do it.\n"
h1yleyh,False,">Willis Carrier was granted the patent for his Apparatus for Treating Air, the first modern air conditioner, on January 2, 1906. \n\nThe ratification of the Bill of Rights was completed on December 15, 1791.\n\nWas the entire US in violation of the Eighth Amendment for 114 years and 18 days? \n\nI'm being snarky here, but my underlying point is that just because circumstances change, that doesn't mean that the laws do. If people think there's a right to climate control, pass another amendment. But don't just say that it's so.\n	>Law has historically changed based on technology. Abortion rights are one of the major hot-button issues right now that is centered around the viability of a child. Something that is purely driven by technology.\n		>But there's a good way and a bad way to do that. Good way is when legislators first allow the technology to proliferate to see how people use it, then they pass laws to deal with it. The bad way is to just force the tech under existing laws as the article is proposing. \n		\n		Yes, air conditioning has proliferated, but people treat it differently. A lot of people in their homes are very reluctant to use it regularly because of the electricity costs and because they prefer fresh air to  conditioned air. Businesses often use it as an attractor for customers. When we're talking about people in prison, maybe it can be a privilege for the prisoners who work more and follow the rules. But I think that pushing it to the level of a right is premature. If someday solar energy infrastructure is so widespread that electricity costs go down to $4 a month, maybe we can talk.\n			>Would you say at any point heat doesn't become a human right. Some extreme examples would be 110 heat index and someone with high blood pressure?\n				>That's where the question actually lies, doesn't it? If A/C isn't provided because of cost that is one thing, but if it's not provided in attempts to *harm* the prisoner that's probably where it potentially runs into an 8th amendment issue.\n				\n				If the judge who provided sentencing to the prisoner didn't outline or bare minimum expect that heat exhaustion would be used as punishment I think the prison could be running afoul.\n					>Well the 8th amendment is vague on purpose because you can't enumerate all the ways that it could be used correct? Can it be side steps by a cost argument? \n					\n					Shouldn't the government provide the basic needs to creat a liveable (not comfortable) environment while under their care.\n						>I only think cost could be used to sidestep it because it wouldn't be a *punishment* to the prisoner at that point, but instead would be an externality to the original punishment.\n						\n						That being said, I think there's considerable evidence that the lack of AC is used as a punishment in of itself. I personally don't see it any different than if the prison established a new policy of whipping the prisoners at 5pm every day, it's just a different form of extrajudicial punishment.\n							>I think our opinions on what the prison system should be differ wildly. But I appreciate you taking the time to explore this deeper with me so I can understand your point of view.\n					>> If A/C isn't provided because of cost that is one thing, but if it's not provided in attempts to harm the prisoner that's probably where it potentially runs into an 8th amendment issue.\n					\n					Even if the second reason is the underlying reason, it's easy to always claim that cost is the reason. A/C will always be more expensive than no A/C (unless medical costs skyrocket or the prison has to defend expensive lawsuits).\n						>Probably depends on the jury if we're going to be realistic here. There is tons of senators, representatives, and even wardens that outwardly exclaim that they don't *want* prisoners to have AC even when cost isn't considered.\n						\n						I doubt this could ever play out in courts with that being said, so many procedural issues connected to suing for this.\n				>[removed]\n					>I understand heating has been around for a long time I don't believe that's in question here.\n						>[removed]\n							>I didn't bring it up in this thread but I did bring it up in my original starter comments is that what you were referring to? \n							\n							In the story say at least 10 prisoners died because of heat should that not be a concern as well? At some point any temperature high or low can kill and if we're protecting against low temperatures why shouldn't we protect against ultra high temperatures?\n								>[removed]\n									>Sorry heat as in the outside temperature. I didn't make myself clear, I will correct that to help other out. Thanks\n			>\>Yes, air conditioning has proliferated, but people treat it differently. A lot of people in their homes are very reluctant to use it regularly because of the electricity costs and because they prefer fresh air to conditioned air.\n			\n			When it comes to heat this is indeed a right in a more traditional sense; a lot of states and municipalities have specific [disconnection notice](https://ncler.acl.gov/Files/Protecting-Older-Adults-from-Utility-Disconnection.aspx) laws for seniors w.r.t. heating. I don't see why cooling would be that different.\n			\n			And if we already acknowledge that it's less luxury and more fundamental for surviving or thriving in an environment, I don't see it as that much of a stretch to think it's something prisoners should have.\n			\n			\>because of the electricity costs\n			\n			I don't think there's many people who would say 'Yeah it's totally fair and great that some people can't afford air conditioning'. People make that argument for, like, iPhones and other 'millenial panic' luxuries, but AC has been around long enough, like you said, to thoroughly proliferate.\n				>I'll say that it's fair and great. In my opinion no one is entitled to anything. Not food, not clean water, nothing that a caveman wouldn't be entitled to. Everything else you earn. Or ask for. We can make it easier to earn, and more likely to say yes if you ask for it, but I think that it's more important to have a universal and perpetual principle of law than to have it creep based on technological advancement.\n					>\>In my opinion no one is entitled to anything.\n					\n					Depending on what you mean by entitled, I agree! I think that natural law arguments are appeals to the supernatural personally.\n					\n					\>Everything else you earn.\n					\n					'Earn' is a normative judgment that is largely based on opinion or personal morality.\n					\n					At the end of the day, if providing air conditioning to both the impoverished and prisoners produces better outcomes, then we should do it, IMO. I don't think that universal perpetual principles of law are very healthy for a society to have. Stability is great, but neither the universe nor human technological circumstance cares much for it, and it seems foolish to pretend otherwise.\n	>The Supreme Court has repeatedly, going up to Gorsuch in [Bucklew, 2019](https://harvardlawreview.org/2019/11/bucklew-v-precythe/) defined 'unusual' in cruel and unusual to mean 'long disused' or not customary. The court doesn't consider if a punishment would be unusual to someone in 1791 — nor to someone in 1689, as the phrase 'cruel and unusual' is just taken from the English Bill of Rights. \n	\n	In [Trop v. Dulles](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1956/70), the court ruled that the term unusual tied the eighth amendment to \n	\n	> evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\n	\n	Even Scalia, in [Harmelin v. Michigan](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/501/957/#tab-opinion-1958878) interpreted 'unusual' to mean not 'in common use' meaning common use today, not 1719.\n	\n	The current court finds that the death penalty to not be unusual, because it's been a traditional punishment in common use going up to the present. However, by this standard, they might find lack of air conditioning to be unusual — it is unusual in the present day for government buildings to lack air conditioning.\n	>That's like arguing that the First Amendment only applies to ye olde printing press and people shouting in the town square.\n	>When you're violating [international law](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/23/teas-prisons-international-human-rights-standard-violations) you're doing something wrong.\n		>When some third-world country violates international law, they're doing something wrong.

h1yplsx,False,">At this point, why bother forcing the issue. If you are vaccinated, you're protected, if you're not, you may face hospitalization. The consequences fall entirely on the individual's shoulders.  What am I missing here? Why are vaccinated people still bothering to wear masks, I might add? People criticize other groups for being anti-science, then proceed to act anti-scientifically.\n	>> What am I missing here? Why are vaccinated people still bothering to wear masks, I might add?\n	\n	There are two reasons that, when taken into consideration, explain why.\n	\n	The vaccine is very effective, but not 100% effective. There are still instances of vaccinated people contracting COVID, though in all those cases the symptoms are mild and there have been no cases of a vaccinated person requiring hospitalization as a result.\n	\n	The point of masks is not to prevent the wearer from contracting COVID, but to prevent the wearer from spreading COVID. I'm not sure where the myth that the primary purpose of masks is to protect yourself came from but it's certainly a damaging myth.\n	\n	So because a vaccinated person can still carry COVID, and the primary purpose of wearing a mask is to prevent the wearer (in this scenario a vaccinated wearer) from spreading COVID, there's still a good reason for a vaccinated person to wear a mask.\n	\n	Personally, anecdotally, mask mandates in my area have been lifted.

Put another way, Reagan, Bush 2, and Trump all talked about conservatives and what they want. And all three had vastly different political platforms that to them meant 'conservative.'

That could refer to different things, and it helps to be specific.\n\nRegardless of what the answer is--blaming either party for border conditions doesn't make a ton of sense. The bad conditions at detention centers have persisted through many different presidents, and neither party has been able to get us to a reasonable solution. Both parties are responsible for what things currently look like.\n\nTo respond to some of your friend's specific claims: \n\nThe problem is definitely not 'Democrats cutting the immigration budget': [Democrats didn't change overall funding of DHS when they took over, and they increased funding for facilities for children](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/biden-border-wall-immigration-budget/2021/05/28/18836084-bff0-11eb-9bae-5a86187646fe_story.html) They're considering cutting funding for detention centers and border patrol in the future, but haven't done it yet.\n\n>He also says the camps can't just let the families go without DNA tests because there isn't a guarantee they aren't human traffickers\n\n[There was a DNA testing program piloted under Trump.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/aug/26/ken-cuccinelli/trump-administration-using-dna-tests-crack-down-fa/) Republicans are trying to make it required, but it currently is not.\n	>I believe he was referring to the camps that were created under Obamas term and the ones currently being scrutinized for the poor conditions. \n	\n	And huh. Then what would he be referring to when he says they cut the budget?\n		>Detention centers at the border existed long before Obama. Obama did build more centers in response to a surge in 2014--most of them *better* than the pre-existing centers. That doesn't mean they were great, though. But they were cleaner, with more room, and air conditioning, which many of the older holding areas don't have.\n		\n		I'm guessing your friends was referencing the 'Obama built the cages' argument, which [this article explains a bit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/kids-in-cages-debate-trump-obama/2020/10/23/8ff96f3c-1532-11eb-82af-864652063d61_story.html). Some of Obama's new detention centers used fencing to separate different demographic groups of people (young men from families, etc.). This had been standard practice for a long time, but in the past they hadn't used fencing to do it. (They'd be kept in separate centers or separate rooms, things like that.) When Trump came into office, he decided to start criminally prosecuting families that had illegally crossed the border. This law had already existed, but previous administrations hadn't applied it to families. This left children alone in the detention centers without their parents, behind the fences that had previously separated different groups, which spawned a thousand news stories.\n		\n		Hopefully this helps illustrate that this isn't just the work on one administration, but of a lot of cumulative decisions by many administrations. The U.S.'s first modern detention center started construction under Carter and was opened under Reagan--although of course American detention centers date back to Ellis Island!--so it's been more than forty years of making the problem worse.\n			>Interesting. Thanks for the info. So I guess it's more of a cumulative problem issue. But what I am wondering is where did the budget statement my friend was referring to come from?\n"
h1fxem4,False,">A quick note about cause and effect in situations like this given your note about the seeming incongruity of 1973 and Reagan. First of all correlation doesn't imply causation. It's very possible that the graph first started to really pick up in 1973 because of natural, reasonable market forces: technology has almost always made folks more productive, or it's possible there's was a bit of a shift in how businesses approached certain things which showed a noticeable increase in productivity, or in the natural curve here we would see some ups and downs and we just happened to have an up right then. The point is, lots of these concepts are very complex and multicausal, especially when we're talking about something as multifaceted as the American economy. It's tempting to look for the 'one thing' that perfectly explains a graph, but the reality is that quite often it's lots of things contributing and even your causal arguments will be somewhat incomplete. But let's not forget: a partial cause is still a cause, and something doesn't have to explain something 100% for it to be a contributing factor.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that sometimes the effect is delayed. So for example, Reagan dissolved the airline unions in 1981. This probably wasn't that big a deal in 1981. For one thing, less union dues put an immediate shot in the arm of workers that replaced those fired in 81. On top of that, a sudden enormous shortage of labor, combined with relatively expensive and time consuming training, combined with the absolute necessity of filling positions quickly, could have created a rather labor-friendly work condition until staffing levels rose and quality of hire started to level out. But once that system got back to a standard baseline...then all of a sudden workers have a lot less protections and wage growth stalls. So even if we didn't see an issue start to develop in this field for another half decade, that doesn't mean it wasn't at its core an issue with Reaganite policies.\n"
h12st26,False,">So, the government doesn't have any direct control over your wages aside from the minimum wage. Companies decide how much to pay you as an employee. \n\nWhile the government technically has a lot of money and it is overly spent on defense, there are still things that require more money than they get now( infrastructure, education, VA, medicare, etc)  and historically saying you want to cut the military budget comes off as 'not supporting the troops'  and losses you votes. Also, in places where they manufacturer or cater to the military can also take a hit.\n\nWhich brings us to taxes. Taxes are as much as civic duty as anything else. It's the primary way the gov gets money. The primary function of the IRS is to collect those taxes( which are set by Congress). Failure to collect that money, even in small quantities can have terrible affects on our debts and deficits. \n\nRich people frequently hire tax lawyers to find loopholes to avoid paying higher taxes. So, while the tax rate might look high, most people don't pay anything near it. While not illegal, it can be harmful to the nation long term.\n\nMoreover, because they have lawyers they are harder to audit, so the IRS just goes for poorer people, because it's cheaper.\n\nSome say, well even if it's less than it's supposed to be, they pay more than the average person, which why technically true goes against the spirit of things.We're supposed to invest in our country. Warren Buffett famously paid less in taxes than his Secretary. \n\nRaising the minimum wage is a good idea and we should do it, but the people affected by it need all that money, since the cost of living has risen drastically.\n"

In short, individuals collecting social security only get a COLA if the average CPI-W for the third quarter of a given year is higher than the average CPI-W for the third quarter of the previous year. That difference, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent, is the COLA. \n	>The problem is the formula used to calculate it is based on a 30-something year old still in the working world.. which means the formula gets two things wrong.  The price of gas matters less to the elderly and disabled because we're not commuting to a job every day any more so when the price of gas drops it lowers their COLA.  Second, they're basing the cost of medications on that which a 30-something year old needs not a 70-something or disabled person needs.  \n	\n	They need to adjust the formula, Elizabeth Warren was talking about it last October/November when the COLA wasn't raised at all.  Now the COLA is going up at such a snails pace people are going to average what? 4-8 bucks more a month?  And then the cost of medicare is going up a couple bucks to then offset that. \n	\n	None of this touches the fact that rents are still going up, electric bills are going up, gas bills are going up (like for stoves/heating/laundry dryers)... \n	\n	There needs to be a change in the formula.

gldslor,False,">I'm from UK, so maybe things are different.\n\nI'm concerned about house prices. Although I have a good job, I cannot get a mortgage for a house as a single person. The max mortgage i can get is £30k less than the cheapest house in my area. Currently, its estimated that the government should build 350k houses per year to keep up with demand. However, they are only managing 170k. This demand is driven by population growth from births and immigration. 73% of the population growth is from immigration. The net immigration is 300k per year. 600k/year gross.\n\nBuilding more houses is difficult in England due to lack of space. Nearly all brown-field sites (ex-industrial) have been used up for new builds already, so the government is under pressure  to build on the green-belt. I think this is a major difference between england and america/other large countries. Size matters. I really think we have too many people in too small a place. We dont have the roads and infrastructure and space to support this fast growth.\n\nSecondly, I'm concerned about values and culture. People are overly naive about the challenges of multiculturalism. Yes, it's great to have a melting pot of cultures that get along. But the reality is that people dont get along very easily. Bringing in too many of different values/cultures too fast creates integration problems. 600k/year is too much. That's 1% of the population every year from immigration.\n\nDivided identities are a problem in many countries across the world. Shia or Sunni. Buddhist or Rohinja. In many countries, there are communities which are not represented by their governments. They are Rohinja muslims living in a Buddhist country. Or Shia Muslims living in a Sunni-lead country. Communities that are not represented will resent the government. This leads to Terrorism and sectarian vlience, and government crackdowns on minorities. As such, it is very important to have governments and parties that represent all communities. \n\nThis inclusive representation is only possible if the values are not too incompatible. You have to contend with the uncomfortable reality, that people from certain countries hold some very incompatible views (Blashpemy and apostasy laws). We live in a democracy. Once such people become citizens, it is the duty of the government to represent those views. Currently, no government party represents such views. So we have growing unrepresented communities. This is a recipe for disaster.\n\nSo take it slow (much slower) and integrate is all i'm saying.\n	>Before I respond I just want to thank you for providing actuall arguments for your position.\n	\n	1) The first part of your comment about massive immigration on small places I have not really thought about to be honest. It is true that massive immigration will temporarily increase the house prices, just as the fact that massive immigration will temporarily lower the wages. However, as I just said these effects are temporary, for example wages might decrease a little since immigrants come, however in the long run they go up. Same thing can be argued for housing. For sure immigration raises the demand for housing & rental accommodation and in small locations immigration might increase the house prices by increasing demand, but I'd argue that that's temporary. However, I'm not sure that the reason you have such high prices in the housing market is immigration. Usually increase in the housing market can be attributed to lax lending standards, restricons on building new houses therefore creating shortages as well as low interest rates. Again I'm not too confident on this matter I'd have to look into it more to provide a more compelling answer. As for the lack of roads and infrastracture I think that that can be attributed to the government's inability to respond to demand. I'm sure that if people who actually care about profit were in charge of those areas, the result would be better.\n	\n	2) About the cultural part. Yes when people immigrate they bring their culture with them and yes plenty of time they bring in stupid and bad ideas. My answer to that is, well if we are so confident that our culture is so better than their own (which it is) what exactly do we fear? Let's create a law that says first generation immigrants are never allowed to vote...why shouldn't the second generation be allowed to vote though? In order for them to leave the garbage behind, we need to teach them to leave the garbage behind and show them that some things that are usual in their countries are not acceptable here. If they attempt to violate rights like force their daughters to get married at 12, if they perform genital mutilation, if they do honor killings or any other atrocity put them in jail and throw away the keys. If anyone is sympathetic to those views don't allow them in. That being said American culture is a strong and can overthrow any culture thrown at it, if it can't that's our problem.\n"
gldywcy,False,">Broadly agree, but its putting the cart before the horse to accept all immigrants BEFORE addressing welfare issues. \n\nAlso, Cato's analysis does not appear to differentiate illegal from legal immigrants. I'd strongly suspect that legal immigrants do in fact use much less 'welfare' than the average American, and indeed we need as many Elon Musks as we can get. Meanwhile, illegal immigrants are overrepresented in crime, and impose costs (for instance kids in public school) that go well beyond welfare. I think another issue is that many illegal immigrants don't really WANT to be US citizens, they just want to work here temporarily, and then go home. We sort of force them to stay because we make it so hard to go back and forth. So, I wish we had more legal immigration and also a way for temporary workers to come and go (with screenings for crime, etc).\n\nSo, I'm all about legal immigrants...but we also ought to rethink who we let in. As the saying goes, this isn't a suicide pact. Imagine you lived in a capitalist village with 100 people, but 200 immigrants wanted to come in, but they all favored socialism. Would you let them in, with the real prospect that your capitalist village would be utterly changed ?\n\nI am not sure how to do it, but we need to let in those that strongly identify with our core principles of individual liberty and freedom, else we are fucked. Perhaps a start would be for the US to admit any and all Hong Kongers and Tiawanese who want to escape real and potential Chinese dictatorship. The US would hugely benefit from millions of new citizens like them.\n"
glejoyi,False,">We definitely need to fix our immigration system to make it easier to become a citizen. We shouldn't let people through without vetting who they are and what value they bring to the country. This is important because it costs money to live anywhere, and it's why borders exist. If one country is doing well financially and everyone floods the country, everyone is left without a place to live among other overpopulation problems and the whole country gets poorer, so we have to find a balance. Beyond this level of detail and in response to the amount of legal immigration allowed now I cannot speak.\n"

It is only when an individual's right to their own life, liberty, property, and pursuit of happiness are protected that a state is Capitalist. Likewise, a Capitalist state can never have slavery of any kind, whereas in a totalitarian state, everyone is a slave, including those in charge. \n			\n			Anyway, that's my doctoral thesis written for you lol.\n"

You could of course track with inflation and cost of living bit it's still not particularly precise in terms of accounting for differences in price trends between essential and luxury items (which also has a great deal of regional variance.)\n	\n	Obviously nothing I have said here is evidence for the claim that capitalism HAS lifted people out of poverty, I just can't find the figures cited in that video as particularly compelling without at the very least tracking vs population growth.\n	\n	Edit: I suppose that middle paragraph there is more or less in agreement with your link now I think about it. The dollar a day figure is an arbitrary one that doesn't account for regional/cultural variance and it's of more value to look at the actual material wealth that can be purchased with the same amount within a specific country.\n	\n	It could still be a useful metric so long as it was consistently applied, but that's hardly a universal standard for 'poverty.'\n	\n	As for the incremental changes to the dollar a day figure...not sure what's going on there.

Depending on the level the number of people under it may have gone up, but the number above that level has gone up more.\n	\n	Also the IPL mentioned in the level for extreme poverty, not the level for poverty.  Its not a claim that anyone above that level is not poor, and video is attacking a straw man when it implies such a claim is made.\n		>That's the thing not all else is equal inflation has to be taken into account with that, it looks like the number is being raised but in reality it's lowered. The video mentions it twice, when talking about the shift, it is quickly mentioned though.\n			>Taking inflation in to account the percentage of people making any figure mentioned in my post or in the video (at least the part I watched, I only watched about a third) has gone down.\n			\n			The video says the number has gone up, but thats with a larger population, the percentage of people under any dollar figure at all $1/day, $2/day $3, $5, $10, $20, $100, $1000... has gone down.

gr17fn8,False,">In Chapter 9, Hazlitt is responding to the argument that laying off Government employees (both Troops and Bureaucrats) would remove their purchasing power.  Essentially, if the government fires these people, then they won't have any money to spend on goods/services, and the economy will shrink, and nobody wants that, so let's keep the Military and Bureaucracies fat and happy.  \n\nHazlitt's response to this is that the if the wages spent on these unproductive Government employees are returned to the tax payers in the form of lower taxes, then the spending power of the private market increases.  As the spending power increases, the demand for goods, services, and employees will increase.  The former Troops and former Bureaucrats now become 'self-supporting civilians' and 'total national production, the wealth of everybody, is higher'.\n\nIt is important to point out that Hazlitt does make a distinction between necessary and unnecessary (productive and unproductive) Troops and Bureaucrats.  It is not an argument to disband the military or remove the bureaucracies, but merely to scale down the public workforce when not needed.\n"

Also I think the main problem is with our current type of democracy, right now our leaders are selected by finding all the most ambitious and greedy people then only taking the ones who were to dumb too get anything done without throwing their name in a lottery and making them the rulers of our country. Instead we should have government be like jury duty where anyone with relevant qualifications for the role has a slim chance of being temporarily drafted into government. We should get together like 5 options this way for each job and then let people vote on it. That way corporate lobbying has no influence and the problems addressed will be relevant to real normal people. And obviously people can have exemptions from having to serve if they meet certain criteria but overall I think the form of democracy above would provide much better results and be more stable. Not sure what to call it yet.\n	>A lot of people here are missing my point. I'm not making a normative judgment about inequality. Whether it's 'good' or 'bad' doesn't really matter for my argument.\n	\n	My argument is people will never be okay with inequality and democracy gives them the means to overturn the system in favor of the masses that have less than the few that have more.\n		>Most people have more invested in the system then they believe they would gain from overturning it so it is stable and will stay that way as long as people have the right amount of personal investment in the success of the current system.\n			>THIS is probably true, and I agree with this. Herein lies the problem with democracy. \n			\n			You have to have people believe that they have more to gain than lose from stability of the current system. \n			\n			But we have politicians constantly telling people that they are being disadvantaged, and that they have more to gain from 'change'.

I'm waiting\n		>Capitalism is economic democracy. The buyer (voter) make a choice (vote) on what to buy, how much and when. They literally vote with thier wallets.\n		\n		Socialism in the other hand is a command economy and allows for no choice at all. Socialism is a form of economic authoritarianism.\n			>You clearly don't know how capitalism actually works in practice; especially in America. \n			\n			Capitalism in America allows our corporations to control the means of production and the lawmakers regulations. The corruption is deep and that's why we have a failed state in America. Corporations use legislation to keep the labor force desperate and poor so they can maintain cheap labor. Lawmakers then print money to help their rich friends and as they money printer goes brrrrr and inflation constantly rises, wages don't and  laborers are suppressed back into the vicious cycle of individualism. Mom and pop business are run out of town because they are too small to compete and they no longer can participate in the free market, thus instead of innovating a new company to compete, they are forced to join the corporation that destroyed their business or starve. \n			\n			Tell me how this makes sense if the laborer 'voted' for better conditions for free market participation yet the state failed to deliver on that and will not bail out the mom and pop businesses but they give bail outs to corporations all day long. \n			\n			How is this practical\n				>You are an idiot. America isn't capitalism, hasn't been since the FED was established. Its a form of corporatism...very similar in its economic makeup to the Nordic states or classical fascist Italy. \n				\n				The definition of corporatism is the control of a state or organization by large interest groups.\n				\n				Capitalism is a social and economic system which recognizes individual rights, including the right to own properties and the possession of goods for the individual's personal consumption. Corporatism, on the other hand, is a form of economy that was created as an option to socialism and intends to achieve social justice and equality without the need to take away private property from individual members of society. It stresses the positive role that government has in ensuring social justice while restraining social unrest as people look after their self-interests.\n				\n				The US hasn't been a free market since the turn of the 20th century because of things like government interventionalism in the economy, social welfare, centralized banking and bail outs. Your problem isn't with capitalism but with government. \n				\n				However socialism isn't the answer to this. The definition of socialism is a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole. Notice that its says production, distribution and exchange...thats control of the entire economy...that's economic authoritarianism.  It's also says owned and regulated by the community...and how does a community regulate things? Through the state. So socialism is state control and regulation of the economy. There is no democracy in that kind of system. Even marx realized this and created the term 'dictatorship of the proletariat', which is a worker run authoritarian government.\n					>Listen here snowflake. You just proved my point. Capitalism doesn't work because it's too easy to manipulate once you win the game of capitalism (which doesn't take long)\n						>Actually it has for a few hundred years now socialist. Capitalism has pulled more people out of poverty than any other economic model. Funny how the Nordic countries you leftists simp over and China had to introduce markets into thier economic models because socialism couldn't pay for all that welfare.\n						\n						Socialism on the other hand had failed everytime its been tried. Imagine simping for an ideology that has a 100% failure rate over the course of 2 centuries. Also imagine getting your economic model from Karl Marx...a man that couldn't even manage a check book. Marx inherited money from his parents which would have given him a middle-class existence his entire life...not only could he not manage that but didn't work most of his life and leached off Engles his entire life. You are following the ideology of a loser.\n						\n						Also like the use of a narcissist smear campaign...you couldn't refute the idea so you went after the person. Typical leftist sociopathic behavior.\n							>The one thing I can agree with is that america is closer to a strict police state with a guided democracy than corporatism or capitalism. \n							\n							You make a good point about Marxist. But I think you also have to recognize that capitalism may have pulled some people out of poverty but it also assures that there's a large group that stays in poverty to keep the cost of labor low.\n								>Again corporatism. The definition of capitalism is an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.\n								\n								It doesn't benefit from keeping a lower class because of the idea of infinite economic growth.

You think Russia doesn't run on greed? You think China doesn't run on greed? What is greed? Of course, none of us are greedy, it's only the other fellow who's greedy. The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests. The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus. Einstein didn't construct his theory under order from a bureaucrat. Henry Ford didn't revolutionize the automobile industry that way. In the only cases in which the masses have escaped from the kind of grinding poverty you're talking about, the only cases in recorded history, are where they have had capitalism and largely free trade. If you want to know where the masses are worse off, worst off, it's exactly in the kinds of societies that depart from that. So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear, that there is no alternative way so far discovered of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by the free-enterprise system.' -Milton Friedman \n								\n								'In practice, socialism didn't work. But socialism could never have worked because it is based on false premises about human psychology and society, and gross ignorance of human economy. In the vast library of socialist theory (and in all of Marx's compendious works), there is hardly a chapter devoted to the creation of wealth to what will cause human beings to work and to innovate, or to what will make their efforts efficient. Socialism is a plan of morally sanctioned theft. It is about dividing up what others have created. Consequently, socialist economies don't work; they create poverty instead of wealth. This is unarguable historical fact now, but that has not prompted the left to have second thoughts.'- David Horowitz\n								\n								'The champions of socialism call themselves progressives, but they recommend a system which is characterized by rigid observance of routine and by a resistance to every kind of improvement. They call themselves liberals, but they are intent upon abolishing liberty. They call themselves democrats, but they yearn for dictatorship. They call themselves revolutionaries, but they want to make the government omnipotent.

gr8de63,False,">The minimum wage is incredibly bad, especially for low income earners, and very bad for wage growth over time.\n\nWages are set by supply and demand as everything else when it comes to trade, and that is what you do when you start working for a company, its a trade. You trade your time and effort for the wage they are offering you.\n\nSo what happens when you install a minimum wage, some people do indeed get paid more, but some other people also loses their job. This creates a larger pool of unemployed people, so companies now dont have to compete so hard with the other companies for the employees they need. This leads to stifled wage growth, because it gives us an inflated pool of unemployed people looking for a job, so companies dont have to increase the wage to find the people they need for their new job offerings. Sadly some of these people will be unemployable, often due to medical conditions or other problems such as an anxiety disorder, depression, alcoholism etc. So they end up firing these people. These people were the people that lost their job when the minimum wage was first installed, but they have experience they can leverage for a job opening, against well abled young people who now find it a lot harder to find a job instead.\n\nThis creates a perverse system, where the young find it a lot harder to find a job, where those that lost their job due to the minimum wage, find themselves in an endless loop of going between jobs and no stability in their life. Endless stress and disappointment for them going from job to job.\n\nBut this further warps the whole market, where companies can now hire people for a few hours only, and force them into getting several different jobs in order to pay their bills. It harms those at the bottom and helps those who are slightly above them, and makes it a lot harder for young people to find a job.\n\nYou could say that the minimum wage gave birth to the gig economy. Now we have the politicians that wants to increase the minimum wage also being against the gig economy. They are against what they produced themselves. It also makes it harder to find meaning through work, because wages doesnt grow as you had hoped they would, so you find yourself stuck at a dead end job that doesnt even improve. Simply because the pool of unemployed people have been artificially increased. So the company you work for simply dont have to care that much about you because there are loads of people who would gladly take your job.\n	>> but some other people also loses their job.\n	\n	No, we have increased the minimum wage a dozen times, it simply doesn't kill jobs. When you dig into the literature, they're chasing noise or trying to play identity politics \n	\n	Years the minimum wage went up https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history/chart\n	\n	Unemployment (adjust years manually) https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000?years_option=all_years\n	\n	> This leads to stifled wage growth\n	\n	No, it gives people a higher floor to negotiate up from, thats why unions support it, otherwise it would be competition to the service that they provide.\n	\n	> This creates a perverse system, where the young find it a lot harder to find a job, where those that lost their job due to the minimum wage, find themselves in an endless loop of going between jobs and no stability in their life.\n	\n	Lets be clear, you are advocating for a low minimum wage so that a 16 year old can bid their salary low enough that they can displace a 28 year old, which does nothing to avoid the scenario that you are having a whinge over. Maybe that teen should have some skill gaining opportunities made available to them, maybe that adult should too. Votech, community college, trades, bootcamps, grants, scholarships, whatever, but understand it requires actually DOING something for these people, rather than using lies to rationalize doing nothing.\n	\n	> You could say that the minimum wage gave birth to the gig economy.\n	\n	Absolutely not, thats a technology thing, or more specifically a politicians haven't kept up with technology thing, but its being corrected. If you set the rate that you are willing to drive for, you are your own boss; if uber says this is what we are giving you, well, you are hardly your own boss.\n"

The equilibrium point should represent the median income for a specific job. Factors that would drive up/down demand would be variables like experience, certifications, time in grade.\n	\n	The price floor can be determined by whatever the minimum wage currently is. \n	\n	However if you bring in 'black market' transactions like baby sitting, teens mowing lawns, or even farm laborers which often work below minimum wage if they aren't citizens. Then you could see what the lowest wage people would actually work for, this wouldn't be a price floor however, it would simply be the lowest point on the graph for the supply line\n		>What are your thoughts on people who are willing to work for free? For example, summer internships or coveted resume building jobs. I feel like those types of people can easily distort the labor market. I am not really sure what my opinion is in the minimum wage in general.  I haven't spent enough time reading the literature. It doesn't seem like a great method for combating poverty but so much more goes into employment than just wages.\n			>It beautiful...if you believe that you can gain knowledge and better yourself learning a trade, hobby, or skill this way you are clearly go getter and the world is better for it.\n"

Spend time properly defining communism, socialism, and capitalism, because without proper knowledge real conversations look like children play fighting. I see some of you arguing in this thread about what is and isn't capitalism, so I'll give communism a go. Communism was defined by marx(the father of communism) as a stateless, classless, moneyless society. He also theorized that the abolition of class and the state would occur by a proletariat revolution. In simple terms, the lower/working class would rise up against the state as it is not a state of working class people, rather people who contribute to the exploitative nature under capitalism. I know that China and the Soviets are often referred to as communist, partly because they called themselves that, but it is FAR from the truth. Simply, China has a government (a dictator), money, and class. Boom not communism. Its rlly that easy. Same with the soviets.

Only governments prevent that.\n					>In an area with no incentive to open businesses there is no competition\n						>In a free market, people are allowed to decide what can be done morally with their income. Some people will be selfish. They will choose to take care of themselves, their family, friends, or even neighbors. Some people will choose to help a larger portion of their country, or even world. This also isn't a decision that is static. There may be a situation where I give to foreign aid but suddenly a catastrophe befalls me and I must take my resources and put them into rectifying my catastrophe before I can eventually re commit to helping with foreign aid once again. Now let's say that an entity we will call 'government' steps in to make these decisions. They take a large portion of my income and re distribute it as they see fit. They may decide to fund a war, or an atomic bomb. They may decide to give money to a country with corrupt leaders. They may decide to give it to impoverished people within my own country. I have now lost a portion of my ability to decide the cause that I actually support and to not support something or someone I do not support. If a disaster befalls me or someone I love, I have less resources to devote to rectifying the issue and must rely on a system in place to decide if my disaster is worse than someone else's disaster in order to receive timely help. To compound the issue, if government has a vast amount of money via redistribution of wealth (i.e. taxes) and has already devoted that money to another country or cause and our country comes into some kind of disaster... It is nearly impossible to take our resources back and therefore the process of fixing our personal problems become far more complicated. To give a real example... The United States Government had a Draft that was a part of United States Law. Many people fought the draft and a lot of political, moral, and social issues came to light because of this. The government argued that a draft was necessary in order to keep the US Military properly staffed. A rare event occurred where the government gave up a piece of it's power and abolished the Draft. The result we have today is a stronger military than ever before where we do not force people to serve our country but allow them to chose morally to serve and also not serve our country. It turns out that some people are morally opposed to violence and need not involve themselves, some people know that they are better teachers than soldiers and chose not to serve, some people want to protect their loved ones and join the Armed Forces in order to do so, and some people feel a sense of duty to their country or even the world and decide to serve. There are many other hypothetical reasons people would choose to serve and also not to serve but I hope you get the picture. Fundamentally for me it comes down to something simple. I believe that people are inherently good and moral. I believe that people make mistakes. I believe that people will almost always make a sound decision if given the opportunity. I believe people's self interest is best served when looking out for others also. I believe that we are not in a zero sum existence. I believe that rising tides float all boats. I believe that Capitalism is historically the best answer that we have at this time, and that there haven't been any novel ideas in regards to political philosophy for a very long time. These issues have already been documented and studied (for some interesting research look into the rise of unemployment in conjunction with the imposition of a welfare system under Roosevelt in the aftermath of the Great Depression and how before 1935 African American communities had a .8% difference in unemployment with Caucasians and today it is around 2 to 1 unemployment. The problem didn't exist before the New Deal but has been one of the main causes of opportunity inequality in the U.S. The New Deal also extended the recovery from the Great Depression and caused unquantifiable amounts of excess suffering in the name of morality and equality.) This is only a small example of the argument that can be made for Capitalism and I am frankly too tired this evening to write more about this. I'm fairly certain that most people's minds are made up as to what they believe in but I used to be somewhat of a socialist until I started learning the facts. It is glaringly obvious that Capitalism is the best system that we have in place and will automatically redistribute wealth far more efficiently that any intervention that chooses our decisions at a macro level. \n						\n						P.S. \n						\n						There is an incentive to open a business in less economically productive countries, but why do it if a country like the USA gives money to an impoverished country in order to prop up it's government and elite? When we give money to a country, we give it to their government, not their people. What incentive does the foreign government have to foster growth when they can just wait for another country to give them welfare in the form of aid and they can redistribute it as they see fit. Examples are military, diplomacy, protection of government officials, travel expenses, political campaigns and much more. This doesn't take into account how morally bankrupt a country may or may not be.\n							>I agree with you, state socialism is a fundamentally flawed system. Hence why I do not advocate for state socialism or communism, I'm an anarchist.

Considering your argument are all but entirely against state socialism and not Anarcho-Syndicalism then I completely agree with everything but one, the idea that there isn't anything better.\n							\n							Anarcho-syndicalism has been in practice before, during the spanish civil war in the CNT. It would have succeeded if not for the fact that both the communists and fascists were attacking the anarchists, they were crushed militarily.

I'm not sure that I am a reasonable person but I try to conduct myself with an open mind. I haven't actually heard of Anarcho-Syndicalism so that sounds like an amazing new thing to learn about which I very much enjoy the prospect of. I also suppose that I misspoke about the idea that there isn't anything better than capitalism. In order to be more accurate I will amend my prior statement to 'I am unaware of any ideas that are better.' Thank you for pointing out my oversight. I do find it extremely frustrating that many people attach some level of their self identification onto their socio-political ideologies and tend to allow their discussions for their preferred ideology to devolve into moral guilt trips, browbeating, and flawed arguments employing various logical fallacies.

This is in the hopes that I supply food for thought to the people who might read what I write. I am under no illusions that I can change someone's mind, but I often feel compelled to speak up just in case something I say may benefit someone.

gsnr06n,False,">Here's my beef with this song: It's attempting to portray the slow downfall of a person that wants to have a hyper-successful business in a capitalist society. The issue with this song is that it makes two assumptions:\n\n1. You have to abandon morals to be successful.\n\n'Swallow all your morals, they're a poor man's quality.' This isn't true. There are lots of immoral people that own mega companies, but there are also lots of moral people that own mega companies. That's because morals do not create value in a capitalist society. Value is dictated by the market. The people. If someone does not think your product has value, they will not buy your product, no matter what your morals are. This is a ploy to get people to think all people who are in business *must* abandon morals to advance. In reality, there's a lot of evidence to show that being a more moral company actually can do better than a company with lower morals. A company that say, treats its employees better, or considers the environment more, has been shown to be in business longer than other companies that don't do these things. Alex Edmans talks about this concept in the [TedTalk](https://youtu.be/Z5KZhm19EO0) he gave a few years ago. It's a great watch, and I'd recommend it. \n\n2. Expansion is...bad?\n\nThe song becomes more intense and paints a more and more grim picture, talking about having 'blood on your hands' and being a 'liar and a whore' (again, assuming you have to abandon your morals to be successful). Why is expansion and being successful a bad thing though? If this successful person is able to start multiple businesses and sell a wide, diverse range of products, then obviously the people buying his products think they have value. They must be products of higher quality at a lower price compared to other companies, or people wouldn't buy them. Why would this be frowned upon? People aren't being forced to buy his products... They obviously want to. Who cares if he sells multiple products? Who cares if he runs for the Unites States? This mystery person is providing valuable products for millions of people. This is a good thing.\n"

gsp3jez,False,">> In 2010, middle-class households in the U.S. had incomes ranging from $35,294 to $105,881 \n\n> Among the countries examined, the middle-class share in Western Europe ranged from 64% in Spain to 80% in Denmark and Norway. By comparison, the U.S. lagged behind, with a middle-class share of 59% in 2010.\n\nSo for those in the US in the middle class, things are better than Europe - as long as you don't hit an unfortunate setback that knocks you out of the middle class.  Far less safety net to fall back on.  One might say more risk, more reward.\n\nFor those below the middle class?  which for us is a far bigger percentage of our population things are not nearly as good.  Far less support systems, especially in areas like medicine and education.  We see this in the dramatic difference in lifespans when you separate by income in the US\n	>To be fair the key to all of this is figuring out how to control runaway costs to housing, education, and of course healthcare. There are significant cash benefits particularly for poor households with children in the United States but those cash benefits such as EITC have not kept up with the inflation in those three areas. I favor looking at potential market solutions particularly with regards to housing and education and maybe a mixed approach to fixing Healthcare. For instance, Singapore has a hybrid market/social health system which is ranked high on the WHO rankings of Healthcare systems in terms of both quality and cost control. The education system should also have robust choices for people even if they are poor (Sweden) and housing policy should remove many zoning requirements that restrict supply (Houston, TX).\n		>What are the zoning restrictions in particular that are restricting supply in Houston?\n		\n		As for education, there is a reason why many in the US are leery of charter schools.  There has been iterations of them used in the past, religious ones, to gut the public school system which is then underfunded and private fees compensate for the lack of funding for the middle class and richer folk.  The poor, particularly minorities, can't afford to pay the full brunt of their child's education.  This was used in the south to combat racial integration.  There have been strong racial problems in the past with the charter school system.  Once you allow for-profit companies in - and a huge variety of them - the information game becomes a problem for the consumer (parents).  Entire classes of kids can miss a year or two of education when a company suffers from poor quality or abruptly closes.  and parents with kids who don't care?  they are totally SOL\n			>I used Houston as an example of low zoning restrictions and the result being more affordable housing. The school choice system works for rich and middle class parents because they can afford private school. Why not provide the means to poor families as well. Also, if a neighborhood is very poor property tax revenues are low so the schools are underfunded. The poor should have the option to go to private schools with the very tax dollars they pay.\n				>This is not to say the US charter system is perfect (far from it) but a government monopoly on low income education is not ideal. The solution to improving educational outcomes among the poor is not a corner solution. There has been some success of low income student scores in urban areas. This heterogeneity of outcome can be utilized to facilitate  better program design.\n					>A lot of urban areas you just have to prop the student up in so many areas to really help their chance to succeed.  Things like the school providing breakfast and lunch if not dinner can have a huge impact on performance.  They often need all school supplies bought for them\n						>As far a federal policy my dream would be to end or significantly reduce agricultural subsidies and reallocate towards food stamps for needy families. These subsidies in this day and age are really just corporate welfare with the window dressing of helping the mostly obsolete family farm.\n				>Houston also has a 360-degree ring where expansion can occur.  Geography constrains them a lot less and only a little bit to the southeast compared to cities like San Francisco Boston or New York.  If they had only a hundred and twenty degree Arc to build out from I imagine they would have many of the same cost issues.  Republican and Democrat alike both get into nimbyism about higher density structures being built in what previously had been single family areas.\n				\n				  Amusingly they are also a story on why zoning regulations matter.  The massive flooding in Houston a year or two ago was made a lot worse by the fact they built over so many wetlands.\n					>Would you not agree that you can build up? There are significant regulations involved in disincentivizing development. Nonetheless, I appreciate your arguments and respectful tone. I maybe a capitalist but far too many times there appears to be a one sided perspective on things and you bring up valid points. How would you choose to facilitate housing affordability? Would you be in favor of an expansion of rental vouchers?\n						>I agree that you can build up, Houston has not, but has the room to sprawl for the most part.  San Francisco has built up a bit more, but has zero room to sprawl. it still has about a sixth of the density that its estimated its pricing would support. it also has earthquake standards it has to build to (which IMO are a must given its location).  Yes, San Francisco needs to build up.  So do a lot of other pricey cities and urban sprawl is an issue in cities like Houston with a problem with commute times vs. housing prices.\n						\n						My main thought to affordability is to subsidize transportation (mass transit) and to re-organize zoning to allow for higher density of housing along those areas where its built.  Usually convenience of either rapid-transit bus lines or light rail spurs a housing boom in the area.  As for rental vouchers, I have no experience with them.\n						\n						Tax policy would tax single family homes (either subdivided or left as is) that are rental properties at a higher rate to drive down demand.  Would also look at possible tax breaks for small size, cheaper new homes being built that can appeal to newer and lower income buyers.  a first time buyer with a spouse, 0-1 kids can be fine with a 800sq ft home.  Here for instance, most new home construction is over 4000.  In my town house prices have jumped over 50k in the last year.  only about 7.5k of that was from land/sq ft pricing.\n						\n						Biden wants to spend 10t over 10 years on infrastructure.  In my opinion little should go to city to city highspeed rail other than brushing up the eastern corridor a bit.  what we need is mass transit quality improving in most significant metropolitan areas in the US.  people overlook that we have the best airport, highway, and freight rail systems in the world. that 10t is needed for mass transit.  for powergrid.  for waterways and sewers.\n						>>Would you not agree that you can build up?\n						\n						Culturally, the US disincentivizes building up. Which can change, but it takes time.\n"

An example of this is your ISP.\n\nAlso the free market does capture the public will, it's when government sticks its hands in the economy it doesn't.

For example, with the ISP, if a company owned all the infrastructure/wiring, it would be very difficult for competitors to raise enough capital to build out their own infrastructure (getting over the barrier to entry). Also, the larger company could afford to strategically lower prices in certain areas to smother competitors before they get large enough to be a threat.

There is no evidence to suggest that this is a viable strategy for eliminating competition. The smaller firms could simply temporarily close until the larger firm exhausts itself. This is not hard to do. The larger firm will have to sustain significant losses for an indefinite amount of time.

You can't because monopolistic corporations and government have a symbiotic relationship. One can no exist without the other.\n"

gswqpsy,False,">Re 'economic freedom', this is only true if it's baked into your definition of capitalism.

If not, do you think it should be?\n				>As it's commonly used in this sub and by other self-avowed capitalists, I think this definition is fairly consistent with that.

gswvm4p,False,">Socialist here, just in case anybody is interested in a response to the question interrupting their reddit capitalist circlejerk.\n\nThe answer lies in the fact that the market place of ideas, where you simply need to have better and more reasonable ones to win, is a myth. The world simply doesn't work this way, especially for ideas that are inconvenient to the classes that hold the most power. Otherwise, the first dude who correctly thought of saying we should have democracy because kings and lords don't have the right to rule would have eradicated the systems of monarchy and feudalism thousands of years ago.\n\nIn reality, socialism is and was in recent history the political arch enemy of the global ruling class, and anybody trying to implement it has found themselves ruthlessly besieged on all fronts. The first and most important front is of course the hearts and minds of people, waged with propaganda and ideology, and that superior external force has a very high chance of winning over enough people to achieve their goals even if their ideas are bad and would make most people worse off. Any socialist naive enough to believe in free speech, and the right of their enemy to freely organize and disseminate propaganda, quickly found themselves murdered and overthrown, usually in coups organized by the Americans or the British as anybody who has studied history will know. Only socialists who understood this and unapologetically did what was necessary to fight it were able to survive, to the great benefit of their people.\n\nIn other words, politics is war and allowing free speech for the reactionary forces of the ruling class is like allowing your enemy to set up a military base behind your front lines in the spirit of freedom and good sportsmanship. Idealistic and stupid.\n\nCapitalists, and I mean real capitalists in power not armchair reddit theorists, understand this just as well as socialists do. Capitalist institutions, especially the intelligence agencies and military of the US or the UK, spent the better part of the 20th century hunting down and exterminating socialists on every corner of the planet by any means necessary, freedom be damned. They have carpet bombed entire for countries for having socialist politics, killing millions, and still claimed it was because they were the authoritarian ones who didn't respect human rights. They are the global sponsors of the liberal ideology of free speech because it's an effective tool of war and manufacturing consent at home for them, and you believe in it because you're not thinking critically enough.\n	>Thank you for this.\n	>>The answer lies in the fact that the market place of ideas, where you simply need to have better and more reasonable ones to win, is a myth. The world simply doesn't work this way, especially for ideas that are inconvenient to the classes that hold the most power.\n	\n	That is a myth because that is an overly simplistic view that doesn't reflect reality. Every entrepreneur knows that building a better mousetrap doesn't mean the world will beat a path to your door. The reality is that success is a complex intermingling of good idea, great execution, understanding the market and your customers, contacts and a host of other things. \n	\n	> ideas that are inconvenient to the classes that hold the most power \n	\n	Capitalism is the best breeding ground for ideas that threaten the status quo. If you watch the markets, especially the tech markets, this happens all the time.\n"

gswyx7k,False,">I would drop the inequality one as well. It's not as related to 'capitalism' per se, as it is to other factors (human capital, capital market health, trading relationships, etc). So like, the idea that inequality is inherently bad and a byproduct of capitalism alone I think a bit unfair to capitalism, and gives socialists a little too much credit.\n\nI might replace it with: the side effects associated with the process of creative destruction can create painful externalities in the short term.\n\nAnd I follow what you're saying on it occasionally being opposed to the greatest social good, but I might phrase it as: negative externalities can go unchecked in the medium term (pollution, monopolies, etc.).\n\nOr something to that effect. Again, over the long running, creative destruction/innovation should relieve those issues, but they can cause societal pain for some periods.\n	>Do you think these painful/negative externalities are some of the biggest risks with capitalism? Or are there other more concerning downsides you would have listed instead? I'm really interested to hear your thoughts.\n		>That's a very good question, albeit admittedly tough to answer.\n		\n		When I really think about the benefits and drawbacks of capitalism, I think that those negative externalities can be problematic in the medium term, but not permanently. Take pollution in the 70s, pollution of common use water ways and land was kinda nasty. I have no idea if there was a government incentive to drive polluting the way some companies did, but regardless, it happened. I think eventually, the waste by-product would have been diminished materially by improved productivity and technology, but it's tough to say when that would've happened and how much additional damage would've been done. That's not to say companies who polluted didn't provide a net benefit, but it did incur an environmental cost. In capitalism though, producers get incentivized to reduce to waste over time as technology improves, so it's still better than a government dictated solution over the long-term. Take Chicago as an example, most of the worst water pollution was done in the 1880s-1910s through animal/beast of burden waste. Once the combustion engine and trucks came along, that pollution basically went to zero, but the Chicago river is still very dirty. There's other factors contributing to the lack of cleanliness, including the local governments, but still it's not clear there was any market incentive to not pollute.\n		\n		The same can be said of free trade - free trade is heavily influenced by competitive advantages. A number of south East Asian countries had significantly lower labor and production costs from the 70s-00s, so US firms eventually responded by sending production abroad while simultaneously becoming more productive through technological improvements. Both reduced US manufacturing employment while the latter improved total manufacturing output. Much of that manufacturing labor is still idle. There's major government involvement in the idleness of that labor, but suffice to say, the market has not responded in a way that has made work more appealing than receiving benefits to many. And it's likely the bulk of that idle manufacturing labor is idle due to government disincentives, but I think the point is still somewhat salient. Angus Deaton has written about these deaths of despair and other tragedies that come about as a function of these lost vocations.\n		\n		Again, a capitalist solution is empirically and materially better to these ailments than a government manufactured one, but the timeline/path dependency of some of these solutions can be a long, painful one. That's my personal opinion, and these examples above didn't happen in a vacuum without any government 'help', but just saying, those costs are there.\n			>So, it sounds like you'd consider negative externalities one of the bigger cons, at least over some time period. (maybe a long time, maybe a short time)\n			\n			If a capitalist solution might take a long time, but the negative consequences are really bad for people now, what do you think is the best way to minimize the negative consequences in the meantime (before a capitalist solution is achieved)?\n"

gz4zhv9,False,">Vast majority of the price jumps have been from economic recovery and slumping supply from JIT manufacturing processes.  Once one JIT process slumps, tons of others have to as well and you get a massive domino effect from the slowdown.  This recovery is far far far faster than past economic recessions given the rather unnatural root of it.  As such supply chains have been considerably strained and proven unable to quickly ramp up to 2019 levels - plus sometimes even a bit more to account for 2 years of wear and tear/loss and population growth.  We had a lot of damage done to the supply side of our economy and it will take time for it to meet demand.  until then, prices are how free markets adjust.\n\nenergy production took a massive hit from very low oil prices last year, with some spot prices even being negative.  it will take time for production that was temporarily offlined to come back.  some producers went bankrupt - their assets will be even harder to get back online in a timely manner.\n\nenergy also took another hit in the form of repeated natural disasters to Texas and surging demand.\n\nCar production cratered due to the chip shortages.  That has pushed up used car prices faster than anything else in the CPI bundle.\n\nI expect month to month inflation will start to level off and decline.  In most sectors this has been a supply side shock induced event.  will be part of many award winning economic studies i imagine, the rather unique events of this epidemic.\n\nmoney supply may still come to haunt us, but it is not at all the main driver of this.\n	>I agree with a little bit of what you said, however the drivers of our current inflation are also futures expectations. The discontinuance of critical pipelines,  demands to halt fossil fuels production in the very near future, and talk of reversing Fed policy as a result of an economy that wants to grow.  Before the pandemic (that I am not convinced was naturally caused) energy prices near me were 1/3rd less than they are now and the economy was firing  all on all 8 cylinders with well timed spark.\n	\n	The chip shortage is also a very convenient thing to have happen now for those who may wish to see the USA destabilized.. For one it shows the insanity of having so much crucial production of important lynch pin supplies inside of or next to hostile nations.\n	\n	We cannot keep throwing trillions of  borrowed dollars around as if it has no consequence.  I remember during a Reagan Carter debate, our soaring national debt was talked about and even some third party fringe candidates talked about it.  And we had not even reached the 1 trillion dollar mark yet. Today we are paying 378 billion dollars a year every year just for interest payments on that debt. That alone would pay for all of our infrastructure needs in this country and allow us to continue to expand our infrastructure as needed going forward. Imagine being able to spend 1 trillion dollars every three years on infrastructure with money that's already being spent. But nope, it flies out the window as interest debt for money that was squandered 20 and 30 years ago.\n	\n	Even if inflation levels off, these new prices will be here to stay and the next round of inflation will have a very high stepping off point. As we are forced into an all electric world (shudder at the prospect) with unreliable production methods and woefully inadequate distribution and infrastructure systems, the prices of all energy is going to skyrocket into unreachable heights for tens if not scores of millions of Americans.\n	\n	Food prices are through the roof now, 2.18 for a can of corn where I live. 12.00+ dollars for a 16 ounce steak.  Is the left forces  land out of food production as promised, and with promises of massive cash giveaways that make todays insane spending look miserly, prices are increasing out of expectations of more shortages and screamingly high overhead costs to come in the near future.\n	\n	If I were in business for myself and I knew my labor costs were going to rise 75%, my energy costs were going to increase, and the costs of the goods I sold or installed were going to continue to climb uncontrollably, I would be raising my prices now to accommodate the upcoming costs and to avoid  super sharp increases that would drive away my customers and potential new customers. This necessary action in the face of increased costs is also an additional driver of inflation, but one that small and large businesses have no other option but to initiate if they want to stay open.\n"
gz6ozmd,False,">So nearly everyone I know voted Democrat this past year.

People of different ethnicities, religious traditions, and backgrounds.\n\nNot a single one of them 'hates who they are', or anything else that you articulated in your video.\n\nIs it possible that you just genuinely don't understand why people are Democrats, or what they believe? Because these sound like the opinions of someone who has been *told about* Democrats more than they've *talked to* Democrats.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm happy to answer any questions anyone might have for someone who votes D. I'm not even talking about arguing, it's just that the characterization of Democrats in this video makes me think that some people would benefit from talking to an actual Democrat lol.\n	>I mean, they are they are the party of free. You can't deny that fact.\n		>Sure I can.\n		\n		I'm assuming that you mean Democrats broadly support giving away free things like healthcare or education, probably either because they're greedy and don't care about the harm that it causes or because they're woefully ignorant and don't understand that the money has to come from somewhere. Is that basically right?\n		\n		So a good chunk of people I know who voted D last year *aren't* for universal healthcare or free college. Of the rest who *do* support those things, only a couple of them support them for altruistic reasons; everyone else supports them for *practical* reasons. The vast majority support -- at most -- making certain expenses more affordable (not free) for especially poor people, usually for economic reasons beyond just a vague interest in giving people things.\n		\n		And beyond those two issues, I can't think of anything where any Democrats have been accused of wanting it 'for free'. Tampons in high schools, maybe?\n			>They want to give this stuff away without any plans on how to fund it and by that, I mean pay for it plus start paying down the national debt\n				>>They want to give this stuff away without any plans on how to fund it and by that [...]\n				\n				Again, I don't agree with this. Taking Medicare for All -- which is really the only expansive 'free' program I can think of that the Democrats have proposed -- in the specific proposal offered by Bernie Sanders, it actually delineates precisely where the money would come from. And analyses by independent think tanks, including explicitly conservative ones, suggest that this program would actually *save* money over time.\n				\n				And Medicare for All isn't even supported by all Democrats, notably Joe Biden up until recently.\n				\n				>[...] I mean pay for it plus start paying down the national debt\n				\n				A lot of Democrats I know, myself included, are very concerned about the national debt. The problem is that Republicans don't offer a realistic alternative if you're someone who prioritizes such a thing; since WWII Republicans, including Trump, have consistently *increased* spending relative to tax revenue. So, indeed, many people vote D precisely *because* they're concerned about the national debt and the Democrats have historically been the only party that actually tries (and, historically, succeeds) at lowering the deficit.\n					>You really want the government to run Medicare for all? They can't run even the simplest of programs without royally screwing them up and yes, Obamacare is one of them. Premiums went up for a lot of people to unaffordable amounts. Obamacare is nothing but a complete disaster that has cost the taxpayers far more than it has saved.\n					\n					The national debt issue can only be tackled by lowering spending or raising taxes. Raising taxes would an idiotic idea to do during a fragile economic time period like today. You also can't cut spending right now because in times of economic decline, the government makes up for the lost spending to soften the blow of a recession. It's keneysian economics 101. It's a tried and true method. \n					\n					As far as paying down the debt, why do democrats insist on taxing the rich to pay for everything. There's a reason long term cap gains is taxed lower than short term. It's to encourage long term investment. When you take that incentive away, people will slow or stop investing long term. This in turn will cause a market decrease which spins off a slew of other problems like unemployment, debt defaults and so on. It will likely also cause capital flight from the US as the rich invest in places where they can avoid the high taxes.\n						>the usual reason a premium went up is because the plan changed from a capped amount of max damages.  A policy is quite cheap when it had a thousand dollar deductible and a 25,000 dollar cap....\n						>We're the only advanced country without universal health care. Singapore's universal health care costs less than half ours (and less than 1/3 the amount we spend GDP) and achieves better outcomes. How is it that a private, for-profit health care system can underperform against other governments who run theirs?\n							>First off, comparing Singapore to the US is a bad example. A few million vs 338 million. Small geographic price differences vs very large ones. A government that serves the people vs one that doesn't. It's significantly harder to administer a program over a large population that is spread out over a large area plus, no one in the US government seems to really care about the issue. \n							\n							On the other end, it's a for profit system that is competing with other providers. They have different systems, different processing times and the bureaucracy behind it is super inefficient. There's also the fact that for profit means the shareholders come first and the company is obligated to make as much as possible for the shareholders, not save money for the policy holders. Competition should in theory drive prices down. \n							\n							There's a multitude of other reasons behind the high costs and inefficiencies like fraud, duplicated efforts, regulations, etc\n								>There are entrenched interests, for sure. They don't want competition because it threatens their cash flow. So right now we have a lack of choice which allows them to provide insurance, then take it away when you get to be too costly for them. They're incentivized to cut costs and this has led to increased regulations, the cost of which has been passed onto consumers. All of the bureaucracy we claim to not want in government is split into hundreds of bureaucracies each providing a cut of profits to shareholders. \n								\n								I just don't think we can defend a per capita cost double that of countries like the UK, which has about the population of California and Texas combined. I could understand there being nuanced which can make costs different in America. I can't agree that it should cost 9k per person per year vs half that in the UK.\n									>I think there is a solution to the problem, but the government taking over isn't the solution IMO. If they can't take care of infrastructure, why should they be trusted with healthcare. Medicare in itself is a failure because you still have to purchase supplemental insurance. It shouldn't be that way. Bureaucracy is what needs to be cleaned up. You should not be told a procedure will cost 3K and then you get a bill for 5K. Transparency in pricing is heavily needed.\n		>Yeah. And if you believe in roads, firefighters, police, FDA, any environmental regulations/conservation efforts, public K-12 schools, etc, then you also believe in 'free'. We just disagree on the details.\n			>So you want to just forgive student debt for those who still hold it and punish those who sacrificed and paid theirs off? Are you suggesting that we just continuously give more in unemployment to people have no incentive to work? How about giving in state tuition to illegal immigrants? These are handouts and this, free. How does this benefit the hard working and responsible tax payer?\n				>that didn't happen partly because democrats can't agree on it.\n				\n				overall, student debt relief is going to be funding higher earning workers.\n"

Young women are far more likely to vote for a communist party than a party of freedom. \n						\n						Psychologically, they feel safer. Women are at risk of having unwanted children and raising the child by themselves if the man disappears afterwards. This is one reason they prefer a much bigger 'safety net' a communist country would support. This is is why you find the majority of women voting for democrat presidencies.. And we're talking about communism, nor Democrats, I get it, but Communism to today's democrats is a couple steps away and a woman wouldn't be more likely to vote for a free market capitalist government if it means less of a 'safety net for her'. \n						\n						The republican party, and I am not a republican mind you, more conservative libertarian, but the republican party is the defacto capitalistic party which is held up by white men mostly, statistically speaking, on average. Well there is white men in the democrat party too! Yeah I get that, but statistically speaking, the majority of republican voters are men like you had mentioned. \n						\n						The voters of leftwing ideas tend to be women, men who come from countries where there is a lack of freedom, and men who want to get laid.

gzaa2o9,False,">Well I think, in America at least, capitalism is not working out very well for the majority of people. And people who are in favor of capitalism are not willing to honestly address its shortcomings. 20% of the population, the professional class, is doing well, including myself. The rest are being squeezed by the rising cost of living, debt and stagnant wages. Unfettered capitalism leads to exploitation, massive wealth inequality, monopolies or oligopolies, and is destroying our environment. Government regulation and intervention can mitigate these problems, but our current political system seems unwilling to adequately address these problems. One political party is only in favor of supply side economics and deregulation, and is unwilling to compromise on anything beyond those policy choices. \n\nAdd to this the fact that Republicans call everything to the left of Milton Friedman or Ayn Rand socialism and you can see why that is gaining popularity among young people. Without a capitalist alternative that creates markets that work for more people, we will continue to see inequality grow and as a result more hatred of capitalism.\n	>'Majority'- the top 75% of all people in the US have seen a net worth increase of at least 37% in the past 20 years. Only the bottom 25% saw a decline, of about 2%. This is the argument that capitalism doesn't work, that the people at the very bottom don't benefit. However for the 'majority' of Americans, it works just fine.\n	\n	https://www.thebalance.com/american-net-worth-by-state-metropolitan-4135839\n		>I said isn't working 'very well' for most people. While the net worth of 75% of people increasing is good, that doesn't negate the fact that our economy is bifurcated between the professional and working class. And it ignore the bottom 25% for which net worth is decreasing. That is a lot of people. Even the source you posted recognizes the gap between the top 20% and the rest. That gap is growing. Wage growth for the bottom quintiles is significantly lower than the top. This is a problem that needs to be addressed or more people will continue to turn on capitalism.\n			>I don't disagree with your statement necessarily. I was taking issue with the use of 'majority' meaning at least 50%. I think capitalism is probably working well for at least half the population.\n				>Yeah it seems that we may just be having a semantic argument. My point is that capitalism is working very well for the top 20%, including myself, but not nearly as well for the rest. I can probably concede that the top 50% of earners are doing OK. But the gap is widening and that is worrisome to me.\n	>you must be a bot lol\n		>I am very much a real person. And I am pro capitalism. There are a lot of benefits to capitalism as a system.

gzabr48,False,">So hi full blown anarchist here. What got me started was when my mom lost her job while I was in highschool. I've always come from a pretty solidly middle class family and as a kid money was the very last thing on my mind, for the most part of I wanted something all I had to do is wait for a holiday and i would always get it. At the time I thought that was normal that's how every family worked\n\nWhen my mom lost her nursing job there was about a year where she was unemployed and searching for a job. Seemed like every week she would have another interview only to get rejected repeatedly.\n\nDuring this time my father just kept getting more and more stressed managing the finances, we had just bought a new house and my mother had just graduated college not to mention my dad was still paying off his student loans so the bills were piling on. I started to notice the holiday gifts got smaller and smaller and less and less of them my parents simply couldn't afford all the things I wanted. \n\nAt this time I was just starting to come out of my 'shell' so to speak so I finally had a small group of close friends that I talked to regularly and through them I learned that this was pretty normal, that not everyone got everything they wanted for Christmas. It was really a shocking realization that made me understand just how lucky I was, I had a good family, my parents had decent paying jobs, we had a nice house, a lot of people don't have these things.\n\nThat summer I picked up a couple of jobs mowing lawns, my parents would never accept it if I gave them the money so instead I bought things like food or gifts for me and my sister trying to ease the burden we put on my parents. I started acting like I didn't care about holidays so the wouldn't feel pressured to buy me gifts just doing everything I could think of to make it easier on my parents.\n\nMy mom eventually got rehired and our finances stabilized a little but I started thinking why, why did we have to budget how much food we were buying why did my dad have to dip into his savings just to make sure the lights stayed on, why does anyone have to go through this? My friends are still dealing with the worries of losing their homes just because they are poor? why does it work this way? Why can't everyone enjoy the kind of childhood I had?\n\nLater on youtube I found an old speech from bernie sanders that got me interested in socialism from him I read a bunch of things comparing the two and listened to other socialists and the rest is history. Sorry that was long I tend to ramble when I'm passionate about something.\n"

gzia7ls,False,">I think the minimum wage is one of the worst federal policies we have. Here's why:\n\n1) Raising it will hurt smaller businesses, as it will be more expensive for them to operate. To compensate they either have to raise prices (which risks them loosing business from their consumers), shorten workers' hours or let some of them go (which leaves them understaffed and less productive), or go out of business.\n\n2) It boosts big businesses as it does not effect their operating costs on a relative scale and hinders competition from a smaller business.\n\n3) It sets an artificial standard for wages. An employer knows that no one expects to be paid more than this amount, so they can just leave it there forever.\n\n4) It takes the power away from the ones that should truly decide what a job's wage is, namely the employee and employer. An employee cannot negotiate the price for their time. They can't say 'I'll do this job better for less,' and secure the job. Likewise it artificially programs employers to not compete for low skilled workers. They can't say 'We'll pay you $2 more than the gas station down the street, because we want better workers here to attract more business than them.'\n\n5) On the political side, the left always wants it to go up, but get more political points for saying that than actually doing it. The right wants it to not rise, but also not go away. It remains in this perpetual limbo of neither side wanting to mess with it for fear of political backlash.\n\n6) A federal minimum wage is an over reach of the federal government into what should be the responsibility of solely the states. (This is the least of my problems with the minimum wage.)\n\n7) Raising the minimum wage and the concept of the 'living wage' stem from this weird idea that you should be able to live and support a family off of any and every job. A job is there because someone needs certain tasks done and these tasks being done will benefit them X amount, so they decide to pay someone less than X to do said tasks so they can make a profit.\n	>>Raising it will hurt smaller businesses, as it will be more expensive for them to operate. To compensate they either have to raise prices (which risks them loosing business from their consumers), shorten workers' hours or let some of them go (which leaves them understaffed and less productive), or go out of business.\n	\n	Canada raised its minimum wage to $15 CAD, nothing happened to small businesses. The costs were passed on the consumer. \n	\n	>It boosts big businesses as it does not effect their operating costs on a relative scale and hinders competition from a smaller business.\n	\n	When regular folks have more money they'll spend more on going to restaurants or buying useless stuff from small and big businesses. \n	\n	There are people with learning disabilities that cannot compete with normal people. They usually work minimum wage jobs all their life. They also need money to pay off mortgage or at least rent.  \n	\n	You are also forgetting that the minimum wage wasn't raised since 2009, the inflation and prices have gone up by a lot since then. Anyone with no skills entering the job market in 2021 for $7 won't be able to afford a living.\n"
gzj0glp,False,">OPINION    |    COMMENTARY (U.S.)\nBiden's Plan Encourages True Supply-Side Economics\n\nPreschool and paid family leave are investments in the future in a way tax cuts for the rich aren't.\nDo you remember supply-side economics? That's the doctrine that claimed that lowering taxes (especially on the wealthy) would cause a gusher of growth and bring in more new revenue than it lost. \n\nIt wasn't true, as the Reagan and Bush tax cuts demonstrated, according to research conducted by William G. Gale and Andrew A. Samwick for the Brookings Institution. Early returns on the Trump tax cuts show they have done little to stimulate growth as well. But certain supply-side policies really could be counted on to augment aggregate supply and increase output. Some of them were even tax cuts. There was good reason to believe, for example, that making depreciation deductions for business equipment and machinery more generous—part of the 2017 tax law—would boost investment and enhance the capital stock. In fact, the results look disappointing. The share of investment moved up, but only a little.\n\nBut many of the most promising supply-side policies involve government spending, including investment in physical infrastructure like roads, bridges, ports and airports.\n\nThe argument for more public investment is essentially the same as the argument for more private investment: If the returns are high enough, future benefits outweigh upfront costs, leaving some 'profit' to the investor. All such arguments are strengthened by today's superlow interest rates, which reduce the cost of capital. Now is the time to invest in the future—both in the private sector and in the public sector.\n\nSelecting the right projects, however, is crucial. This means not limiting ourselves to physical investments like factories and roads, because investments in human capital offer many of the highest returns. Fortunately, much of President Biden's American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan pushes in that direction.\n\nTake two important examples: pre-K education and paid leave. We have known for decades that high-quality education for 3- and 4-year-olds pays handsome dividends. A comprehensive review of existing studies by the Council of Economic Advisers in 2015 concluded that society can gain as much as $8.60 for each dollar invested. \n\nBut you have to be patient. Harvesting these large gains takes a generation or more because so many of them accrue in the form of higher earnings in adulthood. Mr. Biden's proposal for a national partnership with states to offer free high-quality preschool to all 3- and 4-year-olds is likely to pay off long after he has left office.\nPaid family and medical leave get less attention, but they are important parts of the Biden agenda. They are clearly supply-side policies because they would increase labor-force participation, especially among women. The pandemic has shined a bright light on the need for paid leave because so many people, especially women, were forced to drop out of the labor force when illness struck or to care for loved ones.\n\nBut the need long predated the pandemic. The U.S. is the only industrialized nation that doesn't guarantee some form of paid leave to its workers at the federal level. Paid leave is an insurance policy against adversities that many millions of American families face every year. A breadwinner gets sick. A child or other family member, perhaps an elderly parent, needs care at home. A new baby arrives. A mom or dad gets deployed for military service. \n\nThese are normal parts of life. Some can be handled by making child care more available—another part of Mr. Biden's agenda. But many require someone to stay home from work, perhaps for weeks or months. \n\nThe good news is that the pandemic awakened Congress to the need for paid leave. In 2020 it passed emergency-leave measures in two different Covid-relief packages. The bad news is that what little remains (tax credits from the American Rescue Plan, passed this March) will expire at the end of September. America needs something permanent.\n\nThe Biden team proposes to phase in a plan over 10 years that would offer at least two-thirds of average weekly wages for up to 12 weeks of family or medical leave, up to a maximum of $4,000 a month. There will be arguments about whether these numbers should be larger or smaller, but this plan is better than what we have now—which is nothing.\n\nThe largest gains to society will come from providing quality pre-K and paid leave to disadvantaged families. Well-off families already make these investments themselves. It's the poor and near-poor who can't afford either quality pre-K or living without paychecks for a time.\n\nOpponents of programs like these often denigrate them as 'socialism.' I like to praise them as real supply-side economics.\n\n\nMr. Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton, served as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, 1994-96.\n"

gzn6j14,False,">Keeping this extremely short, a single aspect that I think capitalism is far greater than communism is the willingness to take risks. No matter how innovative or perfect they are, every business began with taking risks and is still taking risks. Who will take risks under communism? Will the majority ever vote for taking risks? Will individuals take risks without incentive?  \n\n\nBezos, Musk, or any billionaires(if inherited, their ancestors did) you can name took risks for their fortunes. When I moved to the US from South Korea(2007), I was surprised at America's e-commerce. It took over a week(unsure but extremely long) to get my Wii delivered, and it was stolen. No one took responsibility. Now, thanks to Amazon, two days and full responsibility for any damages.\n\nI doubt innovation can be done under communism because innovators are generally few individuals who are willing to risk everything they have.\n"
gznmfb9,False,">There's partial privatization vs full privatization. Would it also increase efficiency to list the company on the stock exchange in an IPO selling 49% of the stock so the government retains 51%? Or is full privatization necessary to see the benefits?\n\nWhat's important is what are you going to do with the privatization money? When you sell off a state owned company to private investors, revenue is generated from that sale. This is a one time cash flow, it will not come ever again. This money should not be used to cut taxes or increase spending because it will be a one time benefit that only has a temporary effect for one year and then it's gone. So there are four actually good options: paying off government debt, investing the money in a sovereign wealth fund, starting a new state owned enterprise with that capital, or investing it into infrastructure.

It was discovered by the greatest economist to ever live, Ludwig von Mises in 1920, in his book Economic calculation in the socialist commonwealth, and its the nail in the coffin for socialism and communism. \n[Heres a whole document with resources, refutations of refutations and empirical evidence for the ECP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-1wbvrGTIXOn-CMeeJ64zbTjQx3lNxZPrNHXf_LJekI/edit). \n\nYou might also want to look into austrian economics if you havent already\n	>Socialism it just worker owned means of production not central planned economy.\n		>No it is not.

Just on real estate, the poor person has a home worth 50k, it doubles and now is worth 100k, it doesn't make sense to sell because they won't have anywhere to live. The rich have a house worth 250k, it double to 500k, they can sell and buy a house for 100k. They also may have rentals. Their stocks go up. Etc.\n	>Not exactly.

gzutrzc,False,">I assume the chart excludes capital gains, is that right? I think the point that's being missed by the article is that you can have a great standard of living at $400k yearly income and at some point you simply don't need more money. \n\nNot even just that you don't need more money, it's actually bad for the economy to have you hand it to hedge funds who invest it wherever compared to you taking a pay cut and your employer hiring another person to do half your job and you both make enough money to go out to eat, buy a couple of cars, and pay some contractors to remodel your houses.\n\nAnother thing the article misses is that wealthy people are by far the biggest benefactors of the system they're paying taxes into. There's some attempt here to say 'wow, rich people are paying most of the taxes'. But the reality is that this system works well for some people and not so well for others. It's like we're on a plane ride, and there are people riding in first class sipping champagne and doing lines of coke off of hookers' asses, then there are people sitting three deep sharing one seat in coach and splitting a single bag of peanuts. The people in first class should probably be willing to pay a good bit more for their ticket, right?\n\nApart from all of that, my guess is that the lower half of the graph makes up the lion's share of tax returns processed. I recall reading somewhere that there's a large amount of tax revenue that the IRS estimates they are due but don't have the resources to track down. If you look at this on a by return basis, it's probably a better use of resources to not even make people who make less than $100k file or pay income taxes. Removing that processing burden from the IRS should free up enough resources to track down the taxes that are missing while also giving the people in coach a can of soda to go with their peanuts. They might even tip the flight attendant who may then decide to go out and eat at a restaurant.\n	>>I assume the chart excludes capital gains, is that right?\n	\n	What makes you say that?\n		>It was an assumption at first glance, looking back at it now, it says adjusted gross income so it probably does include capital gains.\n	>'You simply don't need more money' spoken like a true thief\n		>Over $400k, how bad do you 'need' more?\n			>Why is it anyone's or the government's business what I 'need'? Some high earners could be a professional who had deferred making money in another job for getting an education, often for a decade or more (eg physicians) with significant debt. Some may be making a lot of money but for a short period of time (business cycles, boom and bust).\n			\n			The point is that if the goal of taxation is for everyone to give a proportional share of their income for shared services, then the 1% is definitely paying a disproportionately larger share, and getting relatively less value.\n				>I'm not saying it's particularly anyone's business, I'm just suggesting there's probably an amount of money where you just don't really 'need' any more. Sure, you can want more, you can get more, but I think there's an amount that people 'need' because we're in a system where people need to use money to purchase food or to pay for a place to sleep. So there's an amount of money that's 'needed', and then there's the rest.\n				\n				Sure, there are many cases where someone made a lot of money one year or the income is the result of prior investments in time or money or both, and the tax system allows those people to write off their student loan interest payments and to put money into accounts that defer taxation.\n				\n				Maybe you're on to something with that last bit. Maybe the goal shouldn't be characterized as paying a proportional share of your income for shared services. In my previous comment I somewhat suggested that taxation is more about keeping the system going, paying for the plane ride. The 1% very much disproportionately benefit from the system as it exists. I don't know how with a straight face to ask people that are struggling to make ends meet for money so the system they're struggling in can keep going. Whereas for the 1%, this is the best plane ride out there, seems like they're the ones with the incentive to keep things trucking right along as is.\n					>What you parasites don't understand is me having more doesn't take away from you.

Sounds like you're suggesting you could never have 'enough', seems like a rough way to live always having to get as much as you can with no end in sight. And who's the parasite in this?\n						\n						I personally don't feel entitled to some man's labor or wealth. I suppose in broader terms, if we see our society as one where we don't want to see people dying of starvation or exposure, then maybe our society is such that each person is entitled to food and shelter? Maybe you're asking what tax rate is fair? \n						\n						Hard to tell where you're going with any of this.\n							>You claim you do not feel entitled to wealth or labor of another, however I would bet you're an advocate for wealth distribution. \n							\n							You propose to rob one man while claiming to be saving another with stolen wealth. How virtuous of you. \n							\n							If you really wanted to raise the standard of living for everyone, then let me ask you this. Is it better to teach a man to fish or feed him a day? \n							\n							What you propose is not sustainable nor is it truly good. Benjamin Franklin articulated this brilliantly.\n							\n							'I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means. I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it. In my youth I traveled much, and I observed in different countries, that the more public provisions were made for the poor, the less they provided for themselves, and of course became poorer. And, on the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they did for themselves, and became richer.'\n								>Do you mean wealth REdistribution? Why, you offering? I do think countries with less wealth disparity tend to have less crime and happier people.\n								\n								I don't recall proposing to 'rob' anyone, I just think when you get more out of something than other people do, you it makes sense that you pay more than other people do.\n								\n								Teach him to fish, all day.\n								\n								I also don't remember 'proposing' anything sustainable or otherwise. If you're referring to when I said our society doesn't want to watch people die of starvation or exposure, I think that's a relatively safe bet. If they don't want to watch that, what are the alternatives? You can either feed and shelter people or not, right? I didn't actually say which I'm for, I'm just saying those seem to be the choices.\n								\n								I like the quote though, but as with most things, I don't think there's a universal truth here but rather an observation being taken out of context. The way I read this, Ben mentions leading people out of poverty, and maybe that ties into your teaching people how to fish bit. Does this really have anything to do with whether or not wealthy people get more for their tax dollars than poor people? I don't read this quote as saying 'tax the poor more so they want to get wealthy'.\n									>The wealthy pay 41% of all taxes in the US and 100% of all net taxes. So, stop regurgitating CNN talking points. Even if we had a flat tax rate of 10% they would still be paying more.\n									\n									Second: that quote is pretty straight forward not open to some abstract interpretation.\n									\n									Three: taxes in general (outside of maybe sales tax) are immoral and theft. It doesn't matter if you're poor or wealthy.\n			>Who decides how much money I need?\n				>Someone smarter than me :). Maybe you. You think you've got what you need?\n	>It includes realized capital gains as income.\n	\n	As for people not needing more, I really don't care.  Its their money whether or not they need it or need it a lot.  Beyond that fact, taking large percentages of it has a negative effect.\n	\n	As for the wealthy receiving more money, they largely are creating the value.   It is something like a plane ride, in that the people in business and first class pay (contribute) more for their space, and by doing so make things better for those in economy class.   Without the first class and business class seats airlines would have to charge more in order to maintain their revenue and if they couldn't charge more (either price controls or more likely just lack of demand) then they would shut down a number of routes. Similarly wealthy people create a lot, without that creation things would be worse for the non-wealthy.\n		>'taking large percentages of it has a negative effect'\n		\n		Not sure I follow this statement. It seems like you're saying no matter how much money someone makes, a large percentage being used to keep the system that enabled them to make that much money has a negative effect. If there isn't enough money to keep the system going, won't they lose more (like 100%)?\n		\n		I think it costs some amount of money to keep the system going and it seems like the people who are making out the best in a system have the biggest incentive to keep it going.\n		\n		I like your spin on the airplane analogy, but I disagree with your take on how much 'value' the wealthy provide. Without first class or business class, maybe all the seats would cost the same amount and maybe the economy seats would be a little better not having to waste all the space taken up by the larger first class seats.\n		\n		Sure, a lot of entrepreneurs create jobs and there's some value there by using their money to pay labor and provide resources to get things done. But some also kill jobs right? Isn't that part of being efficient? The value they create is making more money with fewer inputs or people. And sure, there's some value in a wealthy person having a home built with 23 bathrooms in it and paying some contractors to do the work, but at the end of the day most of their money ends up in a hedge fund to just attempt to grow more money for money's sake.\n			>Most of the money they do pay in taxes do not go towards 'maintaining the system'.  Most government spending is on transfers and benefits to individuals.  Not on infrastructure, law enforcement, the court system, etc. \n			\n			Also the system isn't just government.  Rich people and companies maintain the system was well and they more through their actions that make them money then they do from paying taxes.  Very high taxes discourage their efforts and suppresses the positive externalities for others created by their efforts.\n			\n			>Without first class or business class, maybe all the seats would cost   \n			the same amount and maybe the economy seats would be a little better not  \n			 having to waste all the space taken up by the larger first class seats.\n			\n			I'm not sure I want to argue the details of the analogy for too long, because those details aren't the actual point, but I'll reply at least to this.   First and business class passengers pay more per their area on the plane than economy passengers.  That space isn't wasted it provides a disproportionate share of airline revenue (just as taxes on the rich provide a disproportionate share of government revenue).  If all the seats cost the same amount then they would all have to cost more then current economy seats.\n			\n			>The value they create is making more money with fewer inputs or people. \n			\n			Higher productivity is the only strong long run way to increase income.  Making more money with fewer inputs (including workers as an input), is a positive result for workers, except perhaps in the short run.\n			\n			As for most of the money of the rich going in to investments rather than consumption that's a feature not a bug.  Investment is necessary for expanding, or even maintaining (depreciation is a reality, not just a tax accounting issue) future consumption.   The fact that the rich get more money by making this investment is also a feature not a bug, it provides the incentive to make the investment, and also helps direct towards investment with actual returns (sure big investors can lose money, but they don't want to, and if they continue to do so they will have less money in the future to use for misdirected investment).\n				>It looks like you're excluding transfers and benefits to individuals from 'maintaining the system'. I would argue that those payments do just as much for maintaining the system in that they provide money to individuals to spend on consumption, pay for healthcare, and many other services that end up as income for the wealthy. Those services keep people alive and able to continue working and creating profits for business owners. The 'system' is everything, the people, the infrastructure, national defense, social security, medicare, etc. And wealthy people disproportionately benefit from the system.\n				\n				Last word about the airplane is that it seemed to me that you implied that without first and business class, airplanes wouldn't exist. I disagree and think you could have an airline like Southwest where most of the seats are about the same price and the amount of space you get is about the same as everyone else. The original intent of the analogy was to illustrate how sitting in first class should cost more because you're getting more, and being a wealthy person in an economic system should cost more because you're getting more there as well.\n				\n				I agree that higher productivity is good for the long run and that investment can provide value, I just don't think it's necessarily more value than if the money were used to directly hire and pay people for working. \n				\n				Again though, the value provided by making investments and the returns on those investments are predicated on the system existing. It seems to me that the people that have enough money to pay for their living expenses and still have money left over to make investments and earn returns have more incentives to keep the existing system going then people who don't have enough money to make investments and earn returns. The wealthy get more from the system, it makes sense that they would pay more to keep it running.\n				\n				It's that simple, if you get more from something than other people do, it makes sense that you'd be willing to pay more than other people do. If I were selling a pack of cigarettes, I imagine I'd get more money for the pack from a smoker than a non-smoker.\n					>Transfers to individuals are not maintaining the system.  They are one person, indirectly taking from another. \n					\n					Airplanes and airlines would exist without first class and business class, but losing those classes would be bad for the economy class passengers as they would have to pay more and/or have fewer flight options. \n					\n					The wealthy don't get more from the system collectively, there are a lot fewer of them.  But they pay more collectively not just individually.  That is if you are (and I think you are) equating sending money to the government as maintaining the system.  But the are not the same thing.  Also the wealthy contribute to the economy that sustains everyone through the actions that make them wealthy.  Yes some get subsides or restrictions on their competition etc.  But while that might be a growing problem it still isn't the norm for most wealthy people.  Also the way to deal with that problem, is to deal with that problem, not create more problems by raising taxes to high rates.\n						>Name a transfer to an individual that isn't in some way maintaining the system that has enabled other people to become or stay wealthy?\n						\n						Sure, I get that some people really just want to fly cheap, and there are airlines that target that audience, ever heard of Spirit Airlines? Maybe fewer options for those that want economy class, maybe not. I think getting rid of first and business class will only limit options for people who wanted first or business class.\n						\n						In my mind, yes, these payments to the government maintain the system because without the government the system wouldn't exist. Who would enforce property rights, defend our borders, enforce the laws, etc.? How are these payments not keeping the game going? Someone has to build and maintain a football field for people to be able to play football, the government provides the necessary services for economic actors to participate in the economy and the infrastructure for business to be conducted.\n						\n						Name one of these benevolent actions taken by the wealthy that we're all so desperately dependent on.\n						\n						The original topic here is whether or not it makes sense for wealthy people to pay more in taxes. When you say they don't get more from the system, what do you mean? The taxes are assessed on an individual basis. If you make a lot of money in this system, it seems like this system works really well for you. Anything that works really well for me, I'm willing to pay for. Even more so if it's taxes on income I'm not actually doing any work for.\n							>>Name a transfer to an individual that isn't in some way maintaining the system\n							\n							Off hand I can't think of a single one that is. \n							\n							without the government the system wouldn't exist.\n							\n							Another [system](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf) might exist instead.  But I'm not trying to argue that we should go for that.   My main point is that the majority of what at least the federal government does isn't maintaining the system. \n							\n							As for building fields and parks, either literally or as a metaphor for contributing, the rich do that type of thing all the time.\n							\n							>When you say they don't get more from the system, what do you mean?\n							\n							Everyone gains from order and infrastructure.  There are many more non-rich then very rich people, and collectively the non-rich benefit more because there are more of them.  And the rich and corporations provided a lot of that infrastructure, and some level of maintaining order, more directly, not just from paying a lot of money. \n							\n							>If you make a lot of money in this system, it seems like this system works really well for you. \n							\n							It also means that you work well within the system.  Before even considering any taxes or charity the rich are already benefiting the system (to the extent the economy, or society, or the country is even really a system), and doing so more through their productive activity then they do from their taxes and charity.\n							\n							Also\n							1 - 'Works well from you' does not imply that it gives you a special advantage or that there is a net transfer to you.\n							2 - The system is not the government.  Taxes go to the government.\n							3 - Much of what the government does isn't maintaining the system.  Some of what it does works against the smooth functioning of the economy or any other 'system'.\n							4 - High taxes don't help maintain the system, they make the system work less well.  They discourage and distort investment, encourage seeking and using tax shelters, and move decisions about the use of resources in to politics.\n								>I see you didn't come up with an example, let me try.\n								\n								Subsidized student loans enable businesses the hire more educated people who might otherwise not have gone to college. Medicaid and SNAP keep people healthy enough to continue earning net returns for the business owners that hire them. In fact, I can't think of one that isn't an indirect subsidy to private businesses by either providing labor for business owners to make money off of or giving people money to spend on the goods and services those businesses provide and earn profits on.\n								\n								You keep talking about how few rich people there are and that collectively their benefit is smaller than that of the non rich. Does the collective matter to any of the individuals? Do the rich people get together and say 'ya know, even though each of us is a multi-billionaire, people should realize that collectively there are enough people out there making $40k a year that they actually make more money than us and they should pay more in taxes'. And do the non-rich think 'well, I know I make minimum wage, but there's just too few billionaires out there to reasonably expect them to fork over a higher percentage of their income in taxes than I do. My twenty percent is the difference between my kids sharing a room in an apartment or not, but that $200 million from a billionaire would really set them back'.\n								\n								Bottom line time. Do you think that if you get more utility from something than somebody else does, that you, as a reasonable person, would consider paying more for that thing than those who don't get as much utility as you do from the same thing?\n									>Higher education is to a large extent a private good, someone buys it and benefits from doing so.  And that private good is only partially something that's actually broadly useful, a lot of it is a signaling competition where you get the degree to as a credential and signal to try to out compete others on the job market, but you aren't greatly more productive for having the actual education.  Then at the same time the cost of an education (total cost no matter who pays for it) goes up largely because of those subsidies with much of the benefit of the subsidy going not to the student, or their future employers, or the economy broadly, but to the universities.   Also graduates make more then non-graduates so your giving benefits to those who make more.\n									\n									Welfare benefits are the opposite of a subsidy to private employers.  The fact that people can make money without working increases their reservation rate in order to work.  While at the same time the fact that the employer pays a low skilled worker decreases the amount of benefits paid to that worker.  So the low the benefits increase corporate costs, while the low wage employment decreases government costs.  The exact opposite of what would be the case if welfare was a subsidy to companies.\n									\n									And even if higher education was mostly a massive positive externality, and if welfare was a business subsidy (and both claims are more false then true) they still wouldn't be 'maintaining the system'.   Esp. not the welfare as a business subsidy.  Business subsidies are beneficial for the particular recipients of the subsidy but are broadly negative for the economy.  And maintaining the system for the government is properly more about maintaining law and order, and maybe some basic infrastructure.\n									\n									>You keep talking about how few rich people there are and that collectively their benefit is smaller than that of the non rich. Does the collective matter to any of the individuals? \n									\n									'The collective' matters if the issue is about the groups. If your saying the rich grab everything but really they are collectively contributing more and grabbing less, then your wrong.\n									\n									Even as individuals they typically contribute more and take less.  The transfer is from them to others not from other to them.  Not in every single case of course.  Some rich people got that way through government intervention on their behalf.  Others are criminals (think top mafia figures, or someone like Madoff before he got caught).  But generally most individuals contribute more in taxes then they get in government benefits, and contribute in other ways besides tax payments.  Charity of course, but their biggest contribution is usually their economic action.  Providing skilled labor, providing investment capital, creating new businesses etc.\n									\n									 The bottom line is they already contribute more and take less, whether you limit it to government (taxes paid compared to government benefits received) or consider the situation more broadly.  Also that forcing them to pay a lot more, wouldn't produce better results for everyone else but worse results.\n	>I believe that chart is based off of CBO data and it includes capital gains.

gzwnnov,False,">Taxes are the overall basis for the US economy which allows it to operate and allows it to print money in the first place. \n\nPrinting money was done to stave off a deflationary economic event which takes far, far longer to correct than inflation.\n\nThe purpose of money printing is to stimulate the economy. Although middle class to higher income earners didn't need the stimulus, they are the exception to the rule. When you give low income & poor people money, they spend the money. It doesn't matter if they bought an iphone, nikes or food, all that matters is that it's being spent. The stimulus generates revenue for businesses and tax revenue for state & local governments in a period where it would all be crashing down. Without added stimulus and payroll protection programs, far more businesses would have gone bankrupt, then as more businesses fail, unemployment swells, as unemployment increases, job supply is restricted, when this is restricted people are more willing to take lower wages to replace what they used to receive. As unemployment rises and wages fall, this results in great foreclosures and evictions.

They're not  on your side. They're frightening people who seem to have adopted Marxist ideology as some kind of religion, defending it as if it were their deity.\n		\n		Like, who gets offended when you argue a political or economic system? You have to attach said system to your identity to get that upset about it - that's something theists do about their religion.\n			>Healthcare, equality. That's it buddy.\n				>What are you trying to say with this?\n			>Yep I was arguing about the unrest in the Portland Seattle area today ( in a polite civil way advocating for lawful order and safety for the civilian population) ..\n			\n			One of the leftists wished me death in a few different comments . I tried to remind this grown man that ' hey bro you're an adult now ' I don't get emotional I don't wish anyone harm and it's just astounding how uncivil some folks can be .\n			\n			Personally I think mental illness.\n				>We throw around mental illness far too frequently these days. It's a lack of personal accountability. Many of the trending leftist ideologies (not all) arbitrarily and subjectively attempt to quantify 'goodness' by pointing to externalities as always culprit. The self is never the problem.\n				\n				Ideologies such as critical race theory or much of Marxist ideology are predicated on this kind of nonsense. It's why you can see life-long, career violent criminals like George Floyd become saint-like, or listen as a single mother who gave up her then 17-year old daughter (AND her sister) for adoption talk about how sweet and loving she was before she was killed by a police officer while in the throws of an absolutely enraged homicide. Floyd wasn't to blame for his incessant drug use, criminality, or violent acts, 'the system' is. Ma'Khia Bryant's clearly delinquent parents aren't to be blamed for the tragedy that befell her, it was 'obviously' racism.\n				\n				There's an insanity on the left that's reaching, or even exceeded, virtually anything that's come from the right. The white supremacists have begun to seem a lot less frightening in light of the left's variation, which I could only describe as non-white supremacy.\n				\n				Combating things like racism by USING racism and quantifying that racism by asserting - nonsensically - that non-whites cannot BE racist, is both grotesque and sociopathic, and that's just an examlple.\n				\n				It seems to me that a sheer unwillingness to take responsibility for one's actions seems to be the primary culprit of the left's version of insanity. Don't get me wrong, the right has it's own level of nut jobbery here, but the alt right doesn't quite scare me as much as the Marxist left these days. Bigotry and ignorance predicated on Christian indoctrination - while still vile - makes sense to me. I understand it, because it's like a child not knowing any better. But the bigotry of the left isn't like a child. It's not predicated on any given monotheistic religiosity or cultural tribalism. It seems rooted in itself as if IT were a diety to be worshipped. It's like these far left ideological systems such as postmodernism, Marxism, critical race theory and more have BECOME the 'alt left's' religion.\n				\n				There's something about that that's very unsettling. I occasionally wonder if people didn't think similar thoughts when the 'empires' of Stalin, Mao, or Hitler first began their rise to power.\n				\n				Now I'm not saying I'm actually worried these movements are going to give rise to a dictator or the like, but the nonsense of these ideologies gives me pause, and I can't say the same for the far right. Not anymore.\n				\n				At least when God's put in the mix, religious insanity makes sense. Saying things like logic, reason, and empiricism are systems of oppression, that minorities can't be racist because they're minorities, or that we need (or even can) to abolish private property are not only divisive, but they're fundamentally false declarations espoused as self-evident truth. They're delusions, and they're insane.\n				\n				That's what's scary. Delusion without religion.\n		>.....when it comes to economics......yes ?\n			>All I want is health care. Is that too far left? I mean, every other industrialized nation has it. See, sweeping generalization.\n		>If Leftists all believe the same thing... how can a statement about Leftism not be a generalization?\n			>Then I'm sure it's fine to just make a sweeping generalization about the right being a bunch of 3rd grade educated, religious fanatics who claim to love the constitution without having actually read the document because, you know, guns.\n				>'The right' is a term made up by the left. It's an imaginary, contradictory, enemy they can rally around.\n				\n				Much like 'Capitalism' was a term made up by the left - an imaginary economic system that only benefits people who own capital. Or 'trickle-down economics' and imaginary economic system in which government give money to the rich in order to give money to the poor.\n			>It is called a political *spectrum* for a reason. There is a multitude of possible opinions on the left, just as there is on the right.\n				>That's not what a spectrum is...\n					>From the Cambridge [dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/spectrum): \n					> a range of different positions, opinions, etc. between two extreme points\n						>A spectrum is an axis where a certain property increases or decreases.\n						\n						So with radiation, the spectrum sees the wavelength decrease from left to right.\n						\n						So a political spectrum could be, what percentage of activity should be controlled by government, and *the range* would be 100% - 0%.\n						\n						A list of 'a multitude of possible opinions' is not a spectrum, it's just a list, which you may have drawn on a horizontal line to fit on a ppt.\n							>A spectrum doesn't have a scientific meaning in a political context, as shown by the sourced definition I just provided. Unless, of course, you expect me to trust your words over Cambridge.\n								>If you don't think the word has a meaning, why did you use it?\n								\n								Use words whose meanings you understand from now on.\n									>I meant that while it doesn't have a scientific meaning in that context, it does have a social one (please read the source I sent earlier). I apologise if I was unclear.\n	>This is one of the best TL;DRs on this issue.\n	>This has been my exact opposite experience. When defending a given right-wing economic or fiscal policy, I've only ever heard phrases like 'supply and demand' and 'common sense' and 'where does the money come from?' No one has been able to explain to me, yet, why America's healthcare system is better than Japan's -- even though theirs is cheaper, has better outcomes, and covers everyone -- except for facile arguments like, 'Government-run programs are always bad.'\n	\n	Whereas the most popular policies from the left are those that are crafted by educated professionals like economists and scientists, and that rely on research and data about how different policies perform in different real-world contexts. And the arguments I routinely hear against them can almost all be boiled down to people disagreeing with those professionals on the basis that their conclusions 'don't make sense' or 'I feel like that's wrong' or 'they're getting paid by liberals to say that'.\n	\n	The thing is, it turns out that the real world is complex, economics is more complicated than 'supply and demand', you won't necessarily be able to apprehend everything about a topic you have no education in, and sometimes what seems obvious or common sense to you *isn't true*.\n		>The right leaning left is certainly able to craft rational policies but the base of the left often times seems to be able to comprehend ROI for various pet causes say for instance 'free college' . Supply and demand tells us in the modern world that there are many college fields that are entirely NOT in demand and not worth the investment of funds to educate adults in . Meanwhile the trades are screaming for new workers and paying them accordingly as well . \n		\n		Those of us who are capitalists aren't opposed to government policies that have a meaningful positive economic impact on GDP .  But yeah there has to be some return on investment here considering our nations debt level .\n			>>The right leaning left is certainly able to craft rational policies but the base of the left often times seems to be able to comprehend ROI for various pet causes say for instance 'free college' .\n			\n			So I just want to point out that we used to subsidize college much more heavily than we do now, and almost every other developed nation offers something close to free college. Since we stopped funding it so robustly, we've gone down relative to other countries on almost every education-related metric. At the same time, those countries have seen their economies do better as well.\n			\n			>Supply and demand tells us in the modern world that there are many college fields that are entirely NOT in demand and not worth the investment of funds to educate adults in .\n			\n			I find this phenomen to be very overstated by conservatives. Only ~8% of degrees are in 'social sciences', for example, which includes most of what I'm sure you'd call 'useless majors'. And actually, the more prestigious and selective a school is, the more those majors are represented -- almost 20% of degrees at top colleges are in social sciences, and people who go to Ivy League schools generally don't have trouble applying their degree.\n			\n			>Meanwhile the trades are screaming for new workers and paying them accordingly as well .\n			\n			I'm a big fan of trades. It works different ways in different countries, but in many countries with free college, 'trade schools' exist as programs within the university system. The only reason I can see to treat them differently in the U.S. is because universities are so expensive.\n			\n			>Those of us who are capitalists aren't opposed to government policies that have a meaningful positive economic impact on GDP .\n			\n			Is a policy that increases GDP but lowers the wages of 99% of people still a good thing?\n			\n			>But yeah there has to be some return on investment here considering our nations debt level .\n			\n			The ROI is having an educated society able to compete with other global superpowers like China, and not being in the situation we're in now, which is an entire generation holding nearly $2 trillion in debt that will take decades to work off while earning less than their grandparents, with virtually no savings and no home. This doesn't describe a small group of young adults; the older people in this basket are in their 40s now.\n				>If GDP is increased and 99% of people get their wages cut them obviously we are doing something right because on average we have positive growth across the board .  The only way we will escape our debt burden is by out growing it . \n				\n				Efficiency and GDP growth is what will save us . \n				\n				Even if 8% of college degrees are useless that's still an entire 8% that can be eliminated to save money . ROI baby! \n				\n				I'm entirely fine with the tax payer funding productive endeavors for instance if we wanted to do free TRADE schools for adults I'm 100% on board with that because we can easily guess the pay off on that in the longer run would be more middle class workers and a greater benefit to society .\n					>>If GDP is increased and 99% of people get their wages cut them obviously we are doing something right because on average we have positive growth across the board .\n					\n					To be clear, what is happening in this situation is is that 99% of people are losing money, and 1% are gaining that amount plus a little more.\n					\n					This is a desirable situation to you?\n					\n					>Even if 8% of college degrees are useless that's still an entire 8% that can be eliminated to save money .\n					\n					But that's not an argument against free college.\n					\n					>I'm entirely fine with the tax payer funding productive endeavors for instance if we wanted to do free TRADE schools for adults I'm 100% on board with that because we can easily guess the pay off on that in the longer run would be more middle class workers and a greater benefit to society .\n					\n					Interesting. So you're for free school, but you don't want these free schools to teach, say, science and math. How exactly does that make sense to you?\n					\n					It frankly sounds to me like you're just associating trade schools with 'your side' and therefore something good. I am willing to bet that you don't actually have any data that suggests teaching people HVAC repair is more beneficial for the economy than teaching them, say, chemistry.\n						>Trade schools by and large benefit lower income Americans with poor education, the folks who can't pass the SAT to get into college . \n						\n						My argument against free college is that it's unnecessary , those who do go to college for in demand skills will make that million dollars over their lifetime and More, there's no sound reason to subsidize the white collar middle class . \n						\n						My understanding of those who cry loudest for free college are those who want to go for skills that aren't in demand , that 8 percent . In no way shape or form should the US tax payer fund unproductive economic activity in the way of useless college degrees that cost 50K .\n						\n						In short if someone is going to college it should be to learn a skill that will allow them to pay for their own education that will directly benefit them . Now I'm certainly willing to agree that providing low cost loans or assistance to the very poor who are going to college is a good thing but free college for everyone is just wasteful.\n							>>Trade schools by and large benefit lower income Americans with poor education, the folks who can't pass the SAT to get into college .\n							\n							Has it occurred to you that a bigger barrier to going to college for poor Americans might be how expensive it is?\n							\n							>My argument against free college is that it's unnecessary , those who do go to college for in demand skills will make that million dollars over their lifetime and More, there's no sound reason to subsidize the white collar middle class .\n							\n							The problem is that even with a college degree, people are making significantly less than their grandparents, inflation cuts their earnings by almost a third *every decade*, and people up to 40 years old have virtually no savings.\n							\n							Why is this preferable to you than the alternative? How is our economy going to be competitive in 10 years when we're the only developed nation where most of the country has less than $200 in savings?\n							\n							It honestly sounds like you want to punish people who go to college.\n							\n							>My understanding of those who cry loudest for free college are those who want to go for skills that aren't in demand , that 8 percent .\n							\n							Your understanding is wrong. The vast majority of people who call for free college already have degrees; they wouldn't benefit from free college. In fact, one could argue they'd be the most disenfranchised because they already paid for college.\n							\n							Besides which, those social science degrees are more sought after than you realize. There's a reason why it's the most popular category of majors at the top schools in the country.\n							\n							>In no way shape or form should the US tax payer fund unproductive economic activity in the way of useless college degrees that cost 50K .\n							\n							I'm curious: have you ever taken a social science class? Do you know exactly what they teach? Do you know what kind of work they do? Do you know why everyone, including STEM majors, are expected to have social science credits to graduate?\n							\n							It may be hard to appreciate exactly what value such classes could have if you've never been exposed to their subject material, I think.\n								>Listen to the free market , we don't need more psychologists we need psychiatrists .\n								\n								We have WAY more of the one than the other because of the difficulty with becoming a psychiatrist. \n								\n								If the weaker fields are not so weak then we have no need to worry and once again the free market will sort out the problem and those individuals should be able to find employment sufficient to pay down their college debt .\n								\n								The expense of college CAN be barrier for the poor depending on what kind of degree they want to get .

Psychiatrists wouldn't exist without the research of academic psychologists. Their main difference is that psychiatrists also have a licence to prescribe medicine.\n									\n									>We have WAY more of the one than the other because of the difficulty with becoming a psychiatrist.\n									\n									Well, sure. To become a psychiatrist requires a medical degree and four years of residency; that's at least 8 years longer than an undergraduate program in psychology.\n									\n									You know what would facilitate more people becoming psychiatrists? *Affordable college*.\n									\n									>If the weaker fields are not so weak then we have no need to worry [...]\n									\n									So, all of 'area, ethnic, cultural, gender, and group studies' combined make up 0.4% of all Bachelor degrees.

How can you say that there's no need to worry when people in their 40s have no savings and up to $50k of debt?\n									\n									It doesn't concern you that 10% of our entire national debt is held by people under 40 with college degrees and no savings?\n									\n									>[...] and once again the free market will sort out the problem and those individuals should be able to find employment sufficient to pay down their college debt .\n									\n									And yet, that hasn't happened.

It's not a tremendous fiscal burden if we had free college. In countries that offer free college -- which is every other developed nation besides the U.S. -- the amount government pays for someone to go to college is nowhere near what it costs in the U.S. Like, by at least an order of magnitude.\n									\n									>Our country is broke , unless you can put forth a sound plan that has an excessively high ROI for free college it's a non issue .\n									\n									I point to every other developed nation, as well as Bernie Sanders' plan for free college, which would have cost slightly less than the wall Donald Trump wanted to build.\n									\n									>If there's a REAL return on investment for the tax payer we should do something, if there isn't then there's no need to bother .\n									\n									Most progressive programs -- not just education but healthcare reform, minimum wage increases, etc. -- aren't proposed by bleeding-hearts who don't understand that 'The money's gotta come from somewhere!' That was actually my whole point.\n									\n									Rather, most progressive programs are proposed because it's *more economically efficient*. Places that implemented free college saw their economy *do better*. Places that implemented universal healthcare saved money on healthcare. Places that raised the minimum wage saw increases in both wages and profits.\n									\n									It's not the case that half the country is espousing progressive policies because they're economically illiterate. It's because, even when you take any moral arguments entirely out of the equation, those programs still save taxpayer dollars and/or increase our economic growth. I find it's almost exclusively the people who don't understand these empirically demonstrable economic benefits who argue against them.\n		>Supply and demand can and are influenced and controlled by government through all kinds of means, most particularly the Fed and crony regulations that protect megacorps from competition. The complexity you speak of is a self fulfilling prophecy using circular logic.\n			>>Supply and demand can and are influenced and controlled by government through all kinds of means, most particularly the Fed and crony regulations that protect megacorps from competition.\n			\n			Sure. Who are the ones promoting corporate-friendly protectionist policies? It's not the left.\n			\n			>The complexity you speak of is a self fulfilling prophecy using circular logic.\n			\n			Not at all. The truth is that modern economic theory is simply much more complicated than you've been led to believe.\n			\n			Take minimum wage. If you raise the minimum wage, this raises costs for employers, who raise their prices to compensate, so that the value of the dollar is functionally depreciated and nothing really changes except for a big spike in inflation. That's just common sense, right? How could it possibly be otherwise? Surely people who promote minimum wage increases just don't understand this elementary fact about economics, right?\n			\n			Except that we have empirical data about what happens when you raise the minimum wage, and *that's not what happens*. When you have two adjacent economically comparable regions and one of them introduces a modest increase to the minimum wage, what happens is that the costs are passed on to the entire population, but the increased wages are not. And because low-income people are more likely to spend extra income than high-income people, this means that spending goes up, and businesses tend to make more than enough money to not only offset their increased costs, but also increase their profits. Wages go up, profits go up, everyone does better except for the ultra-wealthy who have to pay 15¢ more for a burger from McDonald's.\n			\n			This isn't some crazy, leftist hypothetical; this is literally what happens, and we've *seen it happen*.\n			\n			This is my experience with policy issues regarding everything from the minimum wage to healthcare reform to tax reform. The arguments against them nearly always presume that, but for government meddling, the economy would function like an idealized scenario you might find in an Econ 101 class. But that's simply, demonstrably not true.\n				>Both parties bear blame, though the left is the winner when it comes to the regulatory environment. This protects large corporations with huge resources from the little guy who might have a better idea and execution were it not for the regulatory barriers and the financial requirement to weather them.\n				\n				As far as your econ 101 lesson, let's talk about how inflation is the most regressive tax of all. Minimum wage increases have to be measured against all effects, not just cherry picked ones. When the government picks winners, no matter if it's big companies or minimum wage earners, everyone eventually loses, and the government then justifies further involvement in a tar baby that can never be unwound. The math is hard, I acknowledge. Maybe the liberal profs with their Keynesian equations make sense to you, but they conveniently leave out the objective, long term effect on the poor, or else the 'problem' would be solved already.\n				\n				I have no expectations that the government will unwind their meddling, but I certainly won't admit that their continued engagement is a net positive. It's not, and now I will wax political, their heavy hand has incredibly long lasting and immoral outcomes.\n					>>This protects large corporations with huge resources from the little guy who might have a better idea and execution were it not for the regulatory barriers and the financial requirement to weather them.\n					\n					I'll concede that market regulations are usually the result of industry lobbyists, and the Republicans and Democrats largely represent competing business interests in this arena.\n					\n					>As far as your econ 101 lesson, let's talk about how inflation is the most regressive tax of all.\n					\n					The thing is that inflation occurs regardless of the minimum wage, and modest increases to the minimum barely increase inflation. Over the last half-century, despite inflation -- which functionally decreases one's earnings by about *30%* every decade -- wages have remained stagnant, and the lowest earners have actually seen their wages go *down*.\n					\n					>When the government picks winners, no matter if it's big companies or minimum wage earners, everyone eventually loses, and the government then justifies further involvement in a tar baby that can never be unwound.\n					\n					See, this is exactly what I mean. That's a very appealing sentiment: it's simple, it makes sense, and it neatly explains all the economic problems that have beset us.\n					\n					But is it *true*? Do you have hard data you'd like to appeal to? Do you have a particular economic journal or theory you'd like to plug that bears this idea out?\n					\n					I doubt that, because I've never encountered any data that would suggest such a thing, and indeed virtually no actual economist would agree with it.\n					\n					>Maybe the liberal profs with their Keynesian equations make sense to you, but they conveniently leave out the objective, long term effect on the poor, or else the 'problem' would be solved already.\n					\n					I don't know if 'solved' is the most germane word, but actually, yes, we can look at how different economies have performed under different policies, and conservative policies almost always end up at the bottom.\n					\n					Since WWII, red states have consistently economically underperformed blue states. They've underperformed so drastically, in fact, that almost all of our non-entitlement federal tax dollars *come from* blue states and *go to* red states. From farm subsidies to Superfund sites, much of the U.S. interior wouldn't even be economically viable but for billions of dollars in *de facto* aid.\n					\n					We can look at the 'Kansas experiment'. A few years ago Governor Brownback introduced hyper-conservative legislation that drastically lowered taxes and government spending. The closest thing to a true anarcho-capitalist utopia ever tried in the West. What exactly happened?\n					\n					The state effectively went bankrupt. They grew their deficit to nearly a billion dollars. Buses stopped running. Schools switched to a four-day week because they couldn't afford to stay open for five. Taxes on the middle and working classes actually ended up *increasing*. They had an outbreak of West Nile virus because they could no longer afford to spray for mosquitoes.\n					\n					The governor's response was to say, 'No, we just haven't cut taxes and deregulated *enough*. This is still the meddlesome hand of Big Government at work.' It was such an unmitigated failure that his own party turned against him, and he was eventually unseated by a Democrat.\n					\n					Or, we can look at the country as whole. By pretty much every metric -- human development, income inequality, real earnings, healthcare, education, crime, etc. -- the U.S. has been in steady decline over the last several decades relative to the rest of the world. What countries have performed better over that time? Scandinavia, the Commonwealth, Japan, Singapore, etc. What do they all have in common? Much more progressive economic and fiscal policies across the board. About the only countries that have *more* conservative policies than us are places like Somalia and Yemen.\n						>Did you just compare the US with Somalia? Was that a series of 'if this, then this must be true' statements? Spoken as a true partisan. We'll see how sustainable those scandinavian progressive economics really are. They might even work. But then again, so does China, and I don't want their version of free economics, either. \n						\n						Eventually, the government's props lose the ability to stay in front of high performing companies and high output employees, and all that is left are beholden politicians and CEOs with protectionism as the primary goal and an underperforming economy, a perpetual cycle of wealth redistribution as each industry matures. Big Coal, railroads, etc., all have fallen out of favor, now replaced by Big Tech's monopolies.\n						\n						I trust the marketplace, as bad as it is, to sort that out much more than I do politicians or economists with their stimuli, subsidies, synthetic interest rates, and heavy regulations, all using our money. I absolutely do not know how anyone can justify the morality of such bullshit when the outcomes clearly have negative consequences for those that can least afford it.\n							>>Did you just compare the US with Somalia?\n							\n							I suggested that the only extant countries with more conservative economic policies than the U.S. resemble places like Somalia and Yemen.\n							\n							Do you have a counter-example? Some country even more conservative than the U.S. that's doing even better by any sane metric?\n							\n							>Was that a series of 'if this, then this must be true' statements?\n							\n							No, it was not.\n							\n							>But then again, so does China, and I don't want their version of free economics, either.\n							\n							China is not at all comparable to any developed nation on any of the metrics I appealed to. Did you just compare Norway to China?\n							\n							>Eventually, the government's props lose the ability to stay in front of high performing companies and high output employees, and all that is left are beholden politicians and CEOs with protectionism as the primary goal and an underperforming economy, a perpetual cycle of wealth redistribution as each industry matures.\n							\n							Sounds like an interesting hypothesis. Do you have any evidence for it?\n							\n							>Big Coal, railroads, etc., all have fallen out of favor, now replaced by Big Tech's monopolies.\n							\n							Yes, companies that traffic in outmoded resources and technologies tend to fair poorly over time. Horse-and-buggy operators and alchemists have also fallen by the wayside.\n							\n							>I trust the marketplace, as bad as it is, to sort that out much more than I do politicians or economists with their stimuli, subsidies, synthetic interest rates, and heavy regulations, all using our money.\n							\n							Before discounting the expertise of economists, don't you think it might behoove you to at least understand the basics of economics? I would never presume to know more than an expert on a topic about which all my knowledge comes from other laymen online.\n							\n							>I absolutely do not know how anyone can justify the morality of such bullshit when the outcomes clearly have negative consequences for those that can least afford it.\n							\n							What are the negative consequences for the places I mentioned? All you offered was some unwarranted certainty that some vaguely bad things will happen to those places, for some reason.\n		>The argument is that the federal government under the Constitution has no business doing 90% of things it does. If states and cities/counties want to set up free, tax-funded  hospitals they can. Many have done that for decades and decades. \n		\n		Pretty much everything should be done at the state and local level. What is good for Manhattan might be ridiculous for Wyoming. The right minimum wage in San Francisco might be devastating economically in Alabama or Puerto Rico.\n		\n		This is true on almost every major issue. The federal government should defend the country (militarily and border patrols), carry out diplomacy and ensure sound money (which it abdicated by creating the federal reserve insanity). The federal courts main job should be to make sure the states don't violate the Bill of Rights.\n			>>If states and cities/counties want to set up free, tax-funded  hospitals they can.\n			\n			I actually agree with this sentiment, but the problem is that small-scale solutions are much less efficient on these issues. What's needed is something that's large-scale that still preserves a vertical separation of powers. I'd be down with an opt-in intra-state public option. Unfortunately, that doesn't look like it's ever going to happen.\n			\n			>Many have done that for decades and decades.\n			\n			Not so much, actually, partly because of the issue mentioned above, but partly because the states that want to implement healthcare reform already spend the most in federal taxes.\n			\n			>Pretty much everything should be done at the state and local level.\n			\n			I broadly agree.\n				>States should not be getting federal money. States and cities/counties should raise their own funds. Federal money comes with strings, which is a way to circumvent the Constitutional separation of powers. States and cities/counties should be self-funding. (cities and counties are agencies of the state, so there is some exchange there)\n				\n				If multiple states want to work together, that's their business too.\n				\n				I don't know what you mean by 'large scale' and 'small scale' in this context. The rural areas and urban areas and different states are all different, no one-size-fits-all system is going to work. The worst thing to happen to healthcare is what we call health insurance. \n				\n				I think health insurance should be replaced for most people. Instead of paying a monthly fee to some company, you should pay the competing hospital system of your choice. Which offers the best coverage for the price? The money you pay then guarantees certain coverage, if you also qualify for state funding that would extend the coverage if you need it.

You and the other residents of your town could start your own insurance that only townies are eligible for. But it's going to cost more than state-wide insurance, which is still going to cost more than country-wide insurance.\n					\n					>I think health insurance should be replaced for most people. Instead of paying a monthly fee to some company, you should pay the competing hospital system of your choice.\n					\n					And what happens when you're out of town? What happens when you need a specialist or machine at another hospital? What happens when a hospital loses power, or when their system is strained by some sort of disaster? Most specialists aren't even found in hospitals. Healthcare providers aren't discrete entities; they share incredible amounts of resources, for the efficiency reasons alluded to above.\n					\n					And what happens when someone is in an accident and no one knows what their preferred hospital is? Do we just let them die? Does everyone need to start wearing dog tags that identify what hospital they're a member of?\n					\n					What happens when there are no decent hospitals near you, because no one figured they could make enough of a profit? What happens when there's only one or two hospitals near you, so they can charge extortionist rates for which you have no recourse?\n"

Every NCO and Officer is taught from day one to handle issues 'at their level' and that if they are unable to its going to reflect poorly on them. My experience in college and in my professional career, this kind of logic doesn't even exist. When certain things happen they just get routed to the people are supposed to deal with those things and in fact, you're mostly discouraged from trying intervene on serious allegations yourself.\n			\n			I currently work overseas in a command that has civilians, military, and local nationals and my closest foreign national co-worker is leaving for another job because of workplace harassment (not sexual). She brought it up to our command XO and it effectively made the situation worse as all the officer and civilians in between basically approached her with 'do you know how this is going to reflect on our department?' and 'do you know now that (harasser's name) and the whole department is going to be investigated?' The reality, there is absolutely zero incentive for Officers or NCOs to escalate issues because in the eyes of the military, its going to reflect poorly on their leadership. That's why you have all the issues with people just getting railroaded out of the command or out of the military, because now the problem has disappeared and nobody has to worry about it.\n				>> Every NCO and Officer is taught from day one to handle issues 'at their level' and that if they are unable to its going to reflect poorly on them. \n				\n				Can't speak of the other branches, but the USAF teaches handling situations at the lowest possible level necessary.  The lowest level could theoretically be anyone in the chain of command, including the Base Commander or higher (if you work at JFHQ or above).  At least personally, I have never felt the need to handle everything at my level.  If it's something that requires a Chief, a Director, a GS-12-15, the local commander, a group commander, and so forth, so be it.  I guess it really depends on where you work in the military.\n			>In the Navy, if a person alleges sexual assault, they are afforded the opportunity to change duty stations. They are not forced to do so. Medical separation secondary to sexual assault is often due to PTSD, depression, and/or anxiety. Recommendation for separation comes from the treating clinician, not the command. Separation can only occur if the member was treated for their condition and, despite treatments, could not return to full duty status (e.g. being on a ship, using a weapon reliably). Medical separation includes financial compensation for the member's disability.\n		>Yep.  And it is widely acknowledged that the problem was not specific to Fort Hood or that unit at Fort Hood.  The Army refused to conduct a similar review process anywhere else (like Fort Bliss down the road, where Asia Graham and her fiancé both committed suicide after being sexually assaulted - Commanders are still in charge, save the company commander now charged with murder).  Military refused to answer why ist's not even bothering to look for it's '#1 priority'.  GEN Milley, our most senior general, continues to say that commanders, who keep screwing this up, are responsible.  When caught, they are almost never relieved.  \n		\n		We don't let commanders with no medical training make medical decisions.  Somehow, with no training, they are better than lawyers?  Judges?

Stories in the last few days undersold the case by describing it as one about fringe benefits, of the sort rarely prosecuted. While it is true that this is a case about unreported income and the failure to pay taxes on it, its scope is greater than many expected, for a few reasons. The scheme charged is a 15-year conspiracy to evade taxes, described as involving numerous Trump Organization executives and employees, only one of whom has been charged so far.\n\n> The indictment alleges the commission of other crimes in addition to the scheme to defraud in the first degree, namely grand larceny in the second degree -- the second most serious white-collar crime available to state prosecutors in New York -- along with various charges for falsifying records. And District Attorney Cyrus Vance has alleged that defendant Weisselberg not only evaded New York State and New York City taxes, but **also evaded federal taxes**, increasing the potential tax loss amount significantly. (While state authorities cannot charge the federal crime of evading federal taxes directly under state law, they can use the federal loss amount in charging the intended scope of the scheme to violate state law, as they have done here).

h3ulq93,False,">Title is beyond fucked up, he isn't asking for a check personally. He's just advocating for reparations For black people in general. \n\nAnd I say that with a pretty strong distaste for billionaires in general.\n\nEdit:\n\nAnd the first couple paragraphs are just as bad, but then the article gives a somewhat decent rundown of reparations (why they're needed, and some of the modern arguments regarding them). What a shame to preceed a halfway decent article (or middle of the article, I actually didn't finish it...) with pure garbage clickbait.\n	>Imagine a group of people come to your home and completely destroy your property and nothing is done to stop them, and there are no consequences after. Now imagine you're promised some kind of restitution for that event, but then the people who promise said restitution lied about it and you got literally nothing. \n	\n	Now imagine asking again down the road and being told that the kids of the people who did it don't see a point in paying restitution because they weren't personally responsible. \n	\n	That's reoperations talks right now.\n		>That's... a gross oversimplification IMO\n		\n		The discussion around reparation centers primarily on generational wealth. How the single greatest indicator of whether someone will be successful and wealth in life, is how successful and wealth their parents are. Wealth begets wealth, and black people in this country were denied the opportunity to access wealth many generations ago. So white Americans were able to build upon generational wealth, having a compounding effect, while black Americans didn't enjoy that luxury. \n		\n		Reparations is about bridging that gap in generational wealth\n			>But it's not just that black people 'were denied opportunities,' it's that for 300 year *everything* was *stolen* from them and they were *horribly abused*. Then for another 100 years they were denied opportunities, most things were stolen from them, and they were still horribly abused. So it's a much more eggregious set of wrongs that led to the generational wealth gaps.\n				>Correct, I should have been more explicit about that\n			>Exactly. There's a very well documented history of black people getting just utterly screwed not just by society but also by the government. \n			\n			And the second they ask for restitution for that history it's met with 'But that was so long ago, can't we just move on? It wasn't me who personally did it so I shouldn't have to foot the bill' \n			\n			It's insane\n		>That's really not a good analogy to use. The response would be:\n		\n		Imagine a group of people came to your great-great-great grandfather's home and destroyed his property without consequences. Now, 250 years later, all of his descendants are seeking compensation from all of the perpetrators' descendants.\n		\n		Among several problems with this analogy, is that reparations aren't a punishment or restitution paid by the perpetrators or their descendants (i.e., there's no guilt implied, no should there be, for the descendants of the guilty). Reparations are paid by everyone in society--via tax dollars, grants of public land, etc. to compensate people who are still impacted today by past actions of society/government.\n		\n		An interesting note... when the Japanese-Americans who were put in concentration camps in the U.S. during WWII (usually losing all of their property) were granted reparations, only those _surviving_ at the time the reparation bill was passed (1988) were granted the $20,000 compensation. The '_surviving_' condition was likely put in to avoid having this bill used as an argument for paying reparations to Blacks for slavery, and left the descendants of people who died before 1988 uncompensated.\n			>Restitution doesn't imply guilt, restitution is merely the restoration of something lost or stolen to it's proper owner. \n			\n			But it's a really good point to note that we've done these kinds of payments for other groups in the past. \n			\n			We literally promised to compensate the black post-slaves for their hardship and the president after Lincoln literally canceled that promise.\n				>> Restitution doesn't imply guilt\n				\n				I completely agree. I think that was a flaw of the proposed analogy.\n	>He is absolutely saying he should get a check and makes a very strong case for why he should:\n	\n	>It just makes good business sense to put capital in the hands of those who have shown they know how to put it to work, he says, if a government program is to be a successful economic stimulus \n	\n	I personally don't agree with this statement, but it is the philosophy the government has followed when distributing stimulus money. Big businesses who don't necessarily need it are the top priority. It's pretty hypocritical to have no qualms about bailing out banks and airlines with white CEOs while saying black billionaires are disqualified from reparations.\n		>But he never refers to himself specifically, like the title implies.\n		\n		Based on the headline, it seems like there should be a quote of his saying 'I want my reparations check'.\n			>It's in the paragraph before the one I quoted. \n			\n			>Johnson argues, and that means wealthy and famous Black Americans like himself—he also names Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, and LeBron James — also should be paid.\n				>...see how there's no quote? And that text is ambiguous on whether *he* says 'like himself' or whether the article says it. There are ways of doing headlines and quotes honestly, and this just isn't it.\n					>You said at the top you have a strong distaste for billionaires but it really seems like you're defending the billionaire and calling the reporter a liar here. Maybe Johnson didn't say it in a quotable way, maybe he just nodded in response to a question, but clearly he said it and went to some length to explain why.\n						>I'm not defending anyone, I'm criticizing sloppy journalism. It's not like Vice is AP, right? \n						\n						I don't like inaccurate headlines. That's not really something I thought people would have a problem with, yet here we are.\n							>You see how you said this, which very clearly indicates you feel the journalist and/or editor are not being truthful, but you aren't comfortable saying 'the reporter is a liar':\n							\n							>There are ways of doing headlines and quotes honestly, and this just isn't it.\n							\n							Maybe Johnson wasn't comfortable saying in so many words 'I should get a check too' but clearly that is what he is arguing.\n								>Okay, there really isn't any point to this argument. I think the headline is dishonest. Whoever wrote it is a liar. Idk why you said I'm not comfortable saying that, and I'm honestly not sure why exactly you feel the need to argue with me. \n								\n								But the headline simply isn't accurate. It's sensationalized. There is no arguing against that. You even agree:\n								\n								>Maybe Johnson wasn't comfortable saying in so many words 'I should get a check too'\n								\n								And if he didn't say it, the headline shouldn't imply he did. That's my opinion. You seem to be supportive of sensationalized headlines, and I'm not. There's really no need to drag this out any further. Have a nice day.\n	>[deleted]\n		>This is wildly misinformed.\n			>[deleted]\n				>Dude just quote the article instead of taking things wildly out if context.

At least that's how I read it. \n		\n		And I do think there was a fair amount of racial fear of pot in the 1930s - The Harlem Renaissance and jazz stoked a lot of racist fervor and weed was included in it. \n		\n		Maybe the 'dry vote' of the Midwest didn't see the connections of temperance in all forms and the racial implications, but the deck was already stacked at that point.\n		\n		Weed played into the whole blackface/minstrel/poor man/crazy man thing just as the fear of rape or theft - at least that's how I read it.

Not even close.\n		>>the correlation between modern marijuana prohibition and colonialism\n		\n		Pretty strong negative correlation from this map. Europe, Australia and the Americas have mostly legal weed while Africa and Asia are nearly all illegal weed countries. The only country in Africa with legal weed, South Africa, was also one of the most brutal in terms of colonialism.\n		\n		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality\_of\_cannabis\n			>Right, but haven't African and Asian countries been determinate of their own drug policy since the end of the era of colonialism after WW2? (I know colonialism didn't end right after WW2 but by and large it was on its way out in the coming decades) \n			\n			Let's take the Philippines for example. I don't think weed is illegal there because it was once a colony of the United States and the US at that time had out-lawed marijuana nationwide. I think it just comes down to a culture divide between the West and the East in general. I mean, we've seen Duterte's policy of out-right vigilante style murder toward any suspected 'drug dealers' as well as the incredibly harsh, brutal sentences handed down for possession of any amount of weed or other drugs. \n			\n			Maybe I just missed your actual point though?\n		>I didn't pay enough attention in my elementary school CRT class to know the answer to this :(\n	>They do and are.

But Leave it to beaver doesn't have the same effect as dudes on ships with guns and slaves getting whipped.\n	>This has nothing to do with racism and/or colonialism. It's not former colonizing countries where weed is most likely to be illegal, and it's not the former colonizing countries who would vote against removing it from the IOC's list of banned substances.

h4esd10,False,">There are two types of Socialism.\n\nDemocratic Socialism and Authoritarian Socialism.\n	>In practice, *all* socialism is authoritarian socialism. There's no way for a free society to operate a command economy. This is why there hasn't been a socialist (by Marx's definition) country that was truly democratic. This is understandable, given the need to seize the means of production. \n	\n	In the US, for example, implementing socialism would involve transitioning 1.8 million businesses to government control and shutting down a stock market worth $46 trillion. There would be some resistance, and due process would take decades. The constitution would have to go. \n	\n	What most people call 'Democratic Socialism' is actually 'Social Democracy' (Sweden, Denmark, etc.). This system is a mixed economy. The majority of GDP comes from private industry, but there is a large government sector, heavy regulation, high taxation and a very generous social safety net. Not a terrible system, actually.\n	\n	Under Marx's 'socialism', the government owns *all* the means of production. No stock market, no nothing. Private property is allowed, but the idea is to gradually adopt full communism, where the state fades away and actual workers (unions) own the means of production. Somehow nobody ever seems to reach this stage...\n		>Every developed country and every developing country supports a Mixed econony.\n		\n		In the US; Medicare for all is popular by the majority of Americans.\n		\n		Legalizing Marijuana is also very popular.\n			>What do Medicare and legal weed have to do with the overall economic system?\n			\n			Capitalism means private ownership of the vast majority of the means of production. Socialism means government ownership of the vast majority of the means of production.\n			\n			Yes, all economies are 'mixed', but government building roads or paying for health care or regulating energy utilities doesn't mean a country isn't still capitalist overall.\n			\n			One example of a truly 'mixed' economy is China. 60-70% of GDP comes from private companies, but private companies are interfered with by the government quite often, and most of them are owned by CCP members. China leans capitalist, but calling them capitalist doesn't make any more sense than calling them communist. Truly mixed.\n				>Medicare for all and legalization of Marauajuana is an example of the Democratic will of the American people being blocked by the Authoritarian Republican party.\n				\n				Socialism is a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned OR regulated by the community as a whole.\n				\n				VS Plutocracy VS Fuedalism VS Communism VS Imperialism VS Tribalism\n					>Try that definition over at /r/socialism. You will find that the vast majority reject any definition that strays from Marx and Engels's writings.\n					\n					It's true that the modern definition of socialism is fuzzy, I am primarily arguing against Marx's version.\n					\n					Marx never said anything about 'or regulated'. He said no private property under communism, and no private ownership of the means of production under socialism. Zero.\n					\n					Marx saw socialism as a transitional stage toward communism. Government ownership was supposed to yield to worker ownership and private property and currency would go away also (which never happened).\n						>They aren't Socialist.  They are Marxists.  Socialism was defined during the French Revolution 40 years before Marx's writings where first published.\n							>All communist countries used Marxism as the model for their socialist phase, so Marx's definition is the most relevant.\n							\n							Also, in developed countries, all commerce outside of the black market is regulated to some degree. Therefore all rich nations are already 'socialist' by your definition.\n								>France is an advanced Socialist country.  So are the Nordic countries.\n								\n								They are not Communist.\n								\n								Communisum is an extreme form of Authoritarianian Socialist and not sustainable.\n									>This is helpful, but the fact that it took us this long to define terms is a big problem.\n									\n									When I hear someone praising 'socialism', I don't know if they are referring to Sweden or Cuba. In /r/socialism it is always Cuba, BTW. This poisons the debate, even though the Swedish/European model has some compelling advantages that should be debated without name-calling and fear-mongering.\n									\n									France and the Nordic countries derive a majority of their GDP from private enterprise. Therefore, I would categorize them as capitalist 'social democracies'. If you choose to call them 'socialist', then I have no major problem with this brand of socialism.\n									\n									I have visited France a lot, and they have a pretty good lifestyle despite a moderately fucked up economy. Sweden and Denmark seem to have done a much better job (I haven't visited Sweden, but it sounds pretty good).\n		>Germany also has a mixed economy, right? It's interesting how they're still able to have such a large GDP compared to others with similar systems. There have to be downsides though, but from the surface, it seems like they have it all. Good economy, free college/healthcare, safety nets, and so on. I've read that taxes aren't terribly higher there than in the US, but it's probably a lot more coming from the lower and middle classes.\n		>There are socialists that aren't Marxists. \n		\n		I consider myself a market socialist. I like democracy, so much so that I'd like to democratize the economy as well lol. Markets are cool. Democracy is cool.\n			>Sounds good. Confusing label, though.\n				>Market socialism is? In short, take a social democracy, and slap worker coops in that bad boy.\n					>And a collective industry. This is why I don't like socialism, collectivism, that you're all entitled to the same thing.\n						>What do you mean by a collective industry? I already said worker coops. \n						\n						I don't think everybody is entitled to the same thing mate. I never said that, either. Actually, I don't think most socialists think that.\n							>That's what collectivism essentially is or at least can be. Not market socialism probably but nobody says what socialism truly entails, I try to look at the big picture.\n								>I don't really know how to address things that aren't true of me or any socialists I know, that you're just attributing to us lmao. \n								\n								I think everybody is entitled to some things, but so does america and almost every western nation. I don't think everybody is entitled to the same thing. \n								\n								I wonder if this is how kings argued when the peasants felt that society was unjust. 'Lol bruh y'all all just want everything to have the same thing, damned collectivists'\n									>It's true though. What do you think collectivism is? What about the commoners who wanted to be individuals, to be left alone? Aren't the workers, according to what the few define socialism is, a state in a way? \n									\n									Funny how socialists support centralized government policies that are actually in place, if you don't believe that socialism is the state seizing the means of production then you sure have a terrible way of acrually practicing it. I actually *dream* of living in an actual free market without crony capitalism limiting it in all its glory and I never support the state. \n									\n									If you're a collectivist then you'd understand why I'd group people into one idea, that they all want the same thing. Escaping or restricting your rights as an individual certainly doesn't help, yet I still don't support anybody being oppressed for anything, especially their ideas. Forgive me, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the state seizing healthcare, childcare, etc. since it's literally the same thing that 'muh proletariat' would do and pretend it's democracy.\n					>OK, but how do you compel the transition to co-ops? What about due process?\n						>How do you compel the transition from slavery? Like, I dunno how it will happen, but it seems like how we make major shifts in how we organize society happen doesn't have a set formula. It could be a long road via reforms (which is what I advocate for), or it could go down more like slavery in America. \n						\n						We could start with different ways of incentivizing the creation of coops and give them some preferential treatment. Like the Marcora Law in Italy, which allows people receiving unemployment to 'cash out' their entire allotment to go towards starting coops. We could offer preferential loans to coops. We can make it so that if a business is going to sell, the employees of said business have to be given the opportunity to buy it before it can be sold externally. These are just some examples of policy to get more coops in the economy to start experimenting with. \n						\n						What about due process? Do you mean 'do existing business owners get due process before their companies are expropriated' or something?\n							>Due process. The fourth amendment prohibits seizure of property without due process.\n							\n							How could you seize 1.8 million businesses legally?\n							\n							BTW: Slavery took a war to abolish. If transitioning to socialism would require a war, count me out.\n							\n							If coops don't make sense without the government putting their finger on the scale, they probably aren't the best approach.\n								>I mean, nothing I suggested under reforms so far involves seizure of property. So, I can't really answer this. But also, I imagine that if the political will were there for it, you could change laws around business. \n								\n								Btw, I wouldn't care what the 4th amendment said about personal property with regards to slavery, slavery was unjust. You could've argued it applied there, or you could argue that just because slaves are personal or private property doesn't mean they should be. Likewise, I don't really care what the 4th amendment says about private business owners, I think worker coops are a more ethical economic structure. \n								\n								Okay. And I'm sure there were plenty of people who felt the same about slavery. The abolitionists didn't care, because slavery was immoral. That didn't make slavery moral, and people saying the same thing now doesn't speak to the morality between the two concepts either. Edit: also, I've never said a civil war is required. I don't think it is, and I'm not some dipshit lefty who wants to start the revolution ASAP. I don't want to see socialism come about because we were the aggressors in a revolution. I want reform, and only violence if the people in positions of power use violence to stop reform. Which they probably would, but that's another story. \n								\n								Why?\n									>Just buy stock in the company you work for then.\n									>True, you didn't mention seizures. Sorry. I am in two different comment threads and I got them mixed up.\n									\n									I suppose that you could adopt pro co-op policies with enough political will. I would just be worried if traditional businesses were punished excessively. If you set a goal to force all businesses to go coop, I think that would end in disaster. If your goal was 20% using gentle carrots and sticks, maybe that would be a net positive.\n									\n									I will have to read up on coops. It seems like one of the sticking points would be start-ups. Venture capital firms and entrepreneurs aren't used to dealing with a coop structure from day 1.\n									\n									Also, what is so magical about coops? It would be a boon for workers in high-growth, high-margin businesses, but these businesses usually provide generous equity plans (stock options) already. As a programmer, I have made more money from options than from salary (mostly due to luck, ofc).\n									\n									Owning a share of a struggling grocery store would be less appealing. It seems like employee ownership (in many cases) would cut down on worker mobility and flexibility to adjust head count in response to economic downturns or changes in consumer preferences.\n									\n									What does slavery have to do with private business? Employees are paid and are free to change jobs. It's literally the opposite of slavery.\n									\n									&#x200B;\n									\n									>I want reform, and only violence if the people in positions of power use violence to stop reform.\n									\n									Violence was the right (only) answer to ending slavery, but it would be a bad idea to consider violence to change a reasonably functional economic system. Once violence starts, you will need a totalitarian central authority to quell it. Capital will flee the country and the economy will collapse, regardless of the system. You will wind up with a command economy. If your plan requires violence to implement, it's not worth implementing.\n									\n									When evaluating how just and effective an economic system is, you have to compare it to history other real world examples, not some perfect utopia that can never exist IRL.\n								>Create a Shakey economy. Businesses fold. Buy it with fiat currency. Inflate the money that you bought the property with. \n								Britain abolished slavery without a war. On the one hand a slave was property. To free the property you had to buy it from the owner. Either that or you could just force people to abandon their property and risk starting a war.\n								I don't know if the united states didnt have a central bank at the time they couldn't issue debt notes they didn't have to back up with gold and silver? They didn't have a printing press that goes brrrrr like they do today.\n								Covid put alot of businesses out of work.\n			>So voting with your dollar? That's capitalism bruh lmao\n				>… no? Where did you get that out of what I said?\n				\n				Also, that's markets bruh.\n			>What if we had a democracy where everyone got together and agreed by vast majority to be capitalist?\n				>Yea, that's what we have now. Thank you smart ass. \n				\n				What if we had a democratic society that decided slavery was okay? Is that an argument for abolitionists to just shut up and let things continue? We can't argue for change and why things should change?\n					>No, I think persuasion is a great way to go. If society decides on an action democratically and a separate party decides change is necessary, there are two options: persuade or start a revolution. \n					\n					I wasn't implying that we shouldn't argue for things to change, either. I'm a capitalist after all, I firmly believe in the marketplace of ideas. I was just curious what your response would be.\n						>Oh I gotcha. Yeah for me, if there's a democracy and the people within it want a capitalist system by and large, then that's what it should be. I'm not the 'revolution of people don't vote my way' type. \n						\n						The only 'revolution' I could see being okay with is like… if either reform/legislation has been passed and it's the other side starting violence in response to it, or the vast vast majority of people want reform, but people in positions of power are blocking it and going against the will of the people.\n							>Yeah, I'd agree; I get the feeling most people would agree with you, too.\n							\n							I don't think the 2020 American election was in any way, shape, or form stolen from Trump, and I think the insurrectionists are rightfully being prosecuted for storming the capital, but it's also interesting to see how far people are willing to go if they truly think the will of the people is being subverted. It kind of makes me feel for those of them that genuinely thought America was being lost to some vague authoritarian political elite behind the scenes. Unfortunately for them and fortunately for the rest of America, that just wasn't the case.\n								>Very good point and something I've said myself. \n								\n								I don't hate the people who were there on Jan. 6th because like… okay yeah if the election legitimately went down the way Trump spins it and they believe, I would call them justified in their actions. Like, the whole point of democracy is to have the will of the people enacted. If there are a small, powerful group of people preventing that, that's when violence would be justified to me. \n								\n								It's just very sad to see how deep Trump's brand of conservatism has rooted itself into some people, along with the rest of the propaganda machine. And scary. \n								\n								Sorry I called you a smart ass earlier lol. Had read a few bad faith replies before that and assumed the same on your end. This was a more understanding conversation than I expected :)\n									>Yeah, I 100% agree.\n									\n									And hahahaha, don't worry about it. Looking back, if I were you I woulda gone off even harder lmao.

This policy was also enacted by France from 1945 to 1975, during which time they had a spectacular average annual growth rate of 5.1%. This cannot be called Socialism or Communism because it includes private ownership over the means of production.\n	\n	>The main French tool under dirigisme was indicative planning through plans designed by the Commissariat général du plan ('Commission for the Plan'). Indicative planning used various incentives to induce public and private actors to behave in an optimal fashion, with the plan serving as a general guideline for optimal investment. During this period France never ceased to be a capitalist economy directed by the accumulation of capital, profit-maximizing enterprise and market-based allocation of producer goods.\n	\n	>In contrast to Soviet-type central planning practiced in the former Soviet bloc, where economic planning substituted private profit incentivized investment and operated the factors of production according to a binding plan, the French state never owned more than a minority of industry and did not seek to replace private profit with central planning. The idea of dirigisme is to complement and improve the efficiency of the market through indirect planning intended to provide better information to market participants. This concept is held in contrast to a planned economy, which aims to replace market-based allocation of production and investment with a binding plan of production expressed in units of physical quantities. \n	\n	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirigisme#Indicative_planning\n"

h4fvvmt,False,">Here's a brief primer from my perspective: if you want a working knowledge of capitalism and economics in general I'd suggest basic economics by Thomas sowell (better used as a textbook for referencing specifics, unless you really want to read through it; it's thick) and capitalism and freedom by Milton Friedman (much more accessible) \n\nIn recent years, the academic and economic battle between cap and soc has been won, and so most modern economic theories are essentially 'capitalist' but don't strictly identify as such and involve some twists on top that (New Keynesians; Behavioral Economics; focuses on Game Theory)\n\nAnother reason for this is due in part to the fact that Austrian, and later Chicago-School, focused primarily on reason to explain economics rather than computer numbers and models (partially because their whole point was that these models are useless because they cannot properly anticipate the market and all of its near limitless factors.). Now a days, there's a huge bias in nearly all academic fields towards computer modeling bc it allows academics (and therefore politicians) some pretty charts and numbers to back up what they say. \n\nSo with that in mind, definitely read up on as much Friedman and Sowell as you can: they'll give you the best theory/framework. As for more modern scholars: try to read around different sources but try to focus on people who actually work in finance because they actually have a track record of being correct. (But don't necessarily throw out anything you read from an academic.)\n\nSorry if that was overlong and I welcome comments and criticisms from everyone else  lol\n	>Couldn't second this comment more.

Your list of properties is nonsense though:\n\n1. real world uses - yes, but nowhere near sufficient to justify its price\n2. scarcity - lots of things (including USD) have this property\n3. unit of account - this one is funny. When was the last time you saw someone price a loan in silver or keep their books in silver?\n4. fungibility - sure\n5. long-term price stability - also ridiculous, it is [down almost 50% in the last 10 years](https://www.apmex.com/silver-price?utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=&utm_source=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiqWHBhD2ARIsAPCDzalAd_56CjOH1o5Er75D5FSCwdwO6sDu4TpR1MgL3HpF9TNX4RujPxAaAokJEALw_wcB). In the covid era it has been on a run up, more than 100% from its low. Stability means staying the same.\n\n>But there is one area in particular that capitalists seem to overlook - and that's the production of the money supply.\n\nPeople on this sub are pretty aware of this. Argument would be better if you stopped there.\n	>USD has scarcity? It has been debased into oblivion\n		>Scarcity here means limited, like the difference between USD and leaves. 'Debased into oblivion' is hyperbole - if I was like gimme a thousand dollars you'd be like 'no, now it's valuable'. If you think it is about to drastically fall in value take out a big loan in USD and buy this guy's silver. You'll be able to pay it back in worthless future dollars.\n			>The issue with USD isn't that it's not scarce, it's that just exactly *how* scarce it is is arbitrary and changeable by government writ.\n				>I won't disagree that the government can and has misused it's ability to print money. I also don't see how banning private money (like we do right now) is in the public interest.\n				\n				The gold or silver standard argument is bad econ tho. Same with crypto as money.\n					>If not crypto or gold than what can be good money?\n						>Money serves 3 functions:\n						\n						1. medium of exchange\n						2. unit of account\n						3. store of value\n						\n						The USD is very good at the first two. It is good for #3 in the short term, but bad in the long term. USD functions well as 'money' as long as you find something else for the long term store of value like stocks, real estate, etc.\n					>> I won't disagree that the government can and has misused it's ability to print money.\n					\n					Normally a spending deficit always results in inflation. Much more so than a 0% interest rate policy.\n					\n					But the US government is in a very particular position to do so with minimal effect on the value of the USD because the USD still is the world's main reserve/forex currency (result of the Bretton Woods system). Meaning there's always significant demand for USD.\n					\n					No other country could ever replicate this spending deficit right now without serious consequences. One could argue the USA is exploiting the good position of their currency to their advantage.\n					\n					This is one of the reasons why the US is blocking significant progress in the federalization of the EU because then the EUR could replace the USD as the world's main reserve currency. Meaning the days for the US's unreasonably high federal gov spending would be over and the necessary austerity would haunt the US like Greece. Possibly up to the complete dissolution of the public order. But more likely the US would just have to seriously cut down military expenses. China's further growth poses a similar danger (CNY).\n					\n					This is actually funny because the parallels to the timeline of the Cyberpunk universe are astonishing.\n						>How does the US obstruct EU federalization?\n						\n						\n						>Cyberpunk\n						\n						Books or the video game?\n					>Nobody here was even arguing in favor of a gold standard. In fact - I was instead advocating that people buy physical silver instead of wasting away savings in a low interest fiat account.\n						>>Silver and gold have multiple things in common that no fiat or cryptocurrency has - real world uses. That is the biggest differentiator between sound money, and other 'transitory' or perhaps 'fake' currencies. Some other important aspects include: scarcity, unit of account, fungibility (meaning every unit is equal), and long-term price stability.\n						\n						Sounds like an argument for metal as money.\n						\n						>savings in a low interest fiat account\n						\n						People don't use bank accounts as investments anymore.\n	>First and foremost, my passion is to let loose the shackles of a monopolized monetary system and to allow for competition so that the free markets can thrive. I want to see the true potential that we as a civilization have by enacting free-trade policies and working together to eliminate unnecessary burdens on the economy. \n	\n	The price of silver rising in the short term is, in my opinion, a necessary occurrence and a pleasant side-effect of the #silversqueeze movement (at least for those who put their money where their mouths are and help support the cause).\n	\n	1- Silver, while being in high demand for jewellery and investment purposes, has a massive potential market for greener technologies and other solar/battery powered initiatives in the not-so-distant future. In 2020 alone, the industrial demand topped 148.6 million ounces, which is approximately 16-17 percent of both the yearly production and demand of silver. To say that a $26+ price tag per oz isn't justified is quite frankly naive.\n	\n	> lots of things (including USD) have this property    \n	\n	I'm strictly talking about inherent scarcity, and USD is not inherently scarce whatsoever.\n	\n	> unit of account\n	\n	While perhaps it's not currently used as a unit of account, it has all the properties that allow it to function as one. This is why on every government-issued silver coin is an inscription of its denominated value. That property wouldn't be disputed if a large percentage of the population start transacting insilver/gold, perhaps using a digital medium such as Kinesis Money.\n	\n	>long-term price stability \n	\n	Ok for this one you are right, it's perhaps not that stable but in my opinion a large reason for that is because it hasn't been used as money for decades, and price suppression/paper contracts still maintain a firm grip on the market. While that is still the case, I'd much rather slow volatility than anything we've seen in the crypto space - and certainly take it over high inflation. But if it were transacted like money again, we'd see price stability to a much greater extent. \n	\n	Lately, we've seen the world we live in reward us for indebting ourselves due to low interest rates, all the while discouraging savings for the exact same reason. We can put an end to this if we all work together. THAT is our goal.\n		>>16-17 percent of both the yearly production and demand of silver\n		\n		16-17 percent is not high, though it looks like much of it is used in other non investment forms. Only [22%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/253345/global-silver-demand-by-purpose/) is in investment form bars / coins / etc. which tbh is less than I expected. However, the speculative investment concerns (price will rise or USD will collapse) are driving the current price. If you were to reduce this component the price would not be near it's current value.\n		\n		>$26+ price tag\n		\n		I can't make a claim as to what price is justified. It may be going to $100 - that's more about how attractive it is as a speculative investment and how afraid people are of USD collapse.\n		\n		>it has all the properties that allow it to function as one\n		\n		The primary property for a unit of account is stability. You don't want a 100k loan that when you pay it back might be 50k or 200k (in addition to interest).\n		\n		If you are successful in running up the price of silver you should realize that using it as a unit of account prior to the run up would have been disastrous.\n		\n		>Kinesis Money\n		\n		Cool, hadn't seen that one. Be careful though, while crypto itself is trustless but these onboarding / offboarding ramps like Tether are usually not.\n		\n		>in my opinion a large reason for that is because it hasn't been used as money for decades\n		\n		Using it as money doesn't automatically stabilize it. Price is still supply and demand and boom / bust cycles are exaggerated by hard money.\n		\n		Price is affected by circulation as well, for example if you put a bunch of silver (or USD for that matter) under your bed for a year you effectively reduce the supply of silver temporarily. Silver (and gold and crypto) have properties that make them tied to the prosperity of the economy.\n		\n		>price suppression/paper contracts\n		\n		I'm not sure what you mean by this. I don't think the price is being suppressed.\n		\n		Bottom line, it isn't good idea to use it as money. The economics behind that are bad. Will it rise in price, idk.\n"

The customer typically doesn't worry about price because they have insurance, and the insurance agencies doesn't worry about price because they are big enough to adjust the price themselves. \n	\n	I honestly think that the abolition of medical insurance would cause prices to go massively down in the medical field because it would force competitive pricing. It would suck in the short term, but make a more sustainable system in the long term.\n	\n	Same sort of thing is with college pricing. As a college student i have been Fortunate enough not to have to take debt to get by degree (or at least, not much debt, haven't finished yet). But the money is available and competition doesn't really exist once you start, and many people I know didn't look at the price tag of the colleges they were applying to (I only did after I got accepted to all the schools I applied to), I didn't go to my first choice school because I didn't want something like 200 k in debt, I went to my second choice school which is now arguably better than my first choice school now that I know more about it. Not to mention the projected salary for a person from the school I am going to is like 10 k / year higher than the other one, another important thing people need to look at. But I see prices raising not really because the quality is increasing that much, but getting the money available from things such as loans is normalising. So the competition to chose a what is right for you is leaving. (Sort of reverse of normal competition instead of colleges competing to get students, students are competing to get colleges, if that makes sense).\n	\n	Both issues have the same core: the customer isn't paying right then and there, they pay later.

Still the same problem.  If it weren't monopolized or restrictive, there would be price and transparency competition.\n			>I view it less as a competition issue and more a money supply issue.

Don't get me wrong, I do think there is an issue with competition, but I don't think it is the main issue.\n				>They're making more money available because the monopolies are demanding it.
