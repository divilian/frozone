This is not all inclusive, also, many types of people on this list could have capitalistic tendencies as well, however, I think on average these people would be more likely to be communist: \n\nPeople who have suffered through an abusive upbringing \n\nPeople with lower IQ's\n \nPeople who are lazy\n\nPeople who have a lot of feelings and rely on their feelings rather than logic\n\nPeople who are abusive\n\nRich people who want to stay in power through use of government control \n\nPeople who have been economically cheated by previous generations and owe mountains of baby boomer debt by the time they are born\n\nPeople who would easily fall into cults\n\nPeople who were raised in wealthy families but never worked for themselves\n\nEnvious people\n\nPeople with lower IQ's\n	>I would add\n	- high levels of entitlement due to spoiled upbringings \n	- think they're being edgy and contrarian\n		>What is inherently noble about labor?\n			>Same reason that pursuing your own self-interest is noble.\n				>Do you mean as opposed to supporting other people in your community (however that is defined) and then supporting you mutually?

It wouldn't exist without workers who actually do the work to run the business.\n									>Capitalists create the tree and the fruit. Workers are just tools in that enterprise. Workers are no different to any other item of plant and equipment. They're there to do a specific defined job that was set up by the capitalist.\n	>any proof on any of these?  I imagine many of these are false.  IQ probably has near zero separation in the groups.  age probably is a far bigger factor.  logic?  so few people actually operate much on it i'd say its also a wash.  abusive upbringing?  Another likely wash.  \n	\n	Very few are really communist or support a significant degree of communism.  most just want a little more government support, so if we are talking about the 5% or less that really could be considered, things could get more interesting.\n	\n	Only ones i'd say would be strongly true?  People who have been economically cheated by previous generations and owe mountains of baby boomer debt by the time they are born.  Age is a high determining factor.  The younger, the more likely.\n	\n	communism is mostly just the red boogieman by the red party trying to get a few word slogan to uneducated and low functioning voters.\n		>I forgot age, thank you. I don't exactly know how you would prove this. OP asked a question and I am answering what I think fits best based off my readings of communism from the Gulag Archipelago, Orwell, and North Korean memoirs. I can go into more detail as to why I think people on this list would be more likely to be communist if you would like me too, there is a logical reason behind it, I didn't just willy nilly write this list based off how I felt. But if you're asking what my proof is as if I am going to cite some peer reviewed papers than I can't help you with that.\n			>I think the most important thing is to definite what exactly would you consider a 'communist'.  personally?  i'd say only a few percent that are on the very fringe of the democratic party (and probably more that are outside the 2 party system entirely) could be considered communist.\n			\n			if however people start lumping in 40% of the US into the 'communists' then the list falls apart on nearly everything.\n				>I was talking about communists, not people in the democratic party, although, I am sure there are communists in the democratic party.\n					>I would imagine the only real factors would be ones that apply to young males - and would probably be nearly equal to young males of other populations, though maybe with a bit more zeal, energy.  any differences between 'communists' and the general population i'd imagine then would be ones found between young men and the general population.  average age i'd venture sub 25.\n						>Actually women are statistically more significantly likely to vote for bigger government. Young women are far more likely to vote for a communist party than a party of freedom. \n						\n						Psychologically, they feel safer. Women are at risk of having unwanted children and raising the child by themselves if the man disappears afterwards. This is one reason they prefer a much bigger 'safety net' a communist country would support. This is is why you find the majority of women voting for democrat presidencies.. And we're talking about communism, nor Democrats, I get it, but Communism to today's democrats is a couple steps away and a woman wouldn't be more likely to vote for a free market capitalist government if it means less of a 'safety net for her'. \n						\n						The republican party, and I am not a republican mind you, more conservative libertarian, but the republican party is the defacto capitalistic party which is held up by white men mostly, statistically speaking, on average. Well there is white men in the democrat party too! Yeah I get that, but statistically speaking, the majority of republican voters are men like you had mentioned. \n						\n						The voters of leftwing ideas tend to be women, men who come from countries where there is a lack of freedom, and men who want to get laid. Seriously, it is far easier to get laid with big government policies. Women feel more secure and consequences are lacking. The government replaces the husband. \n						\n						I could go on and on... But this is some psychological insight into why a communist party wouldn't mostly make up young men, although, the young men that would be in it would tend to fall into the list I made.\n							>While democrats and those who lean towards social programs do indeed tend to be women, the actual communist identifiers - tend to be far more radical in their ideology - a strong male trait.  social programs do not in anyways = communism\n							\n							Also while the republican party says its capitalist, its anti-free market on a huge array of issues.  both parties probably score around the same there.\n								>Well sure, men would initiate a communistic uprising but women, especially young women would be more likely to choose that rather than freedom. Especially young women raised in today's societies where morality is far and few between. \n								\n								The republican party isn't laissez faire but it sure as hell scores much higher then the Democrat party.\n									>Personally I find it rather ironic when people talk about the 'morality of young women' yet preach against economic welfare.  selective biblical reading...\n							>You obviously don't even know what communism or socialism is. Pretty sure you don't even know what capitalism is\n								>I have read the entire gulag archipelago.

Though I'd love to know why you think communist are abusive?\n	>True communism is actually anti-government (there is no government), so, you just proved that you actually don't even know what communism is about.\n		>In dream land maybe. In practice, it aims for extreme authoritarianism with an abstractly defined withering away of the state at an undetermined date that never happens.\n			>That's why violent revolution is part of the path to ensure true communism happens.

Fact: more people AND businesses leave California each year due to overregulation, high taxes, high cost of living, superficial Hollywood newcomers, overcrowding, my God, there must be much more! I'm sorry it wasn't contained in California, the disease has spread certainly and regrettably to Washington state, Oregon and Colorado. It has spread to most other states as well. It was clearly done - it seems like certain companies that attract a certain type of people decided to set up camp in the most densely populated cities thus infecting most large cities. The infection also emanates from schools of all grades through university. The talk was BIG: The media was bought, all 6 major companies organized through ProPublica to coordinate local, regional and national news sources. Corporate was bought to push the agenda through policy in ads, social media, employees. Polls were bought to see the real results and relay false results.\n	\n	The talk was so BIG it fooled the average sheep. \n	\n	\n	We later learned that whole branches of government AND government agencies had failed to protect our checks and balances as hours and hours of testimony and physical hard evidence of voting and election fraud were collected and made public. The media with 95% control of all media withheld the information. Luckily some trickled through.\n	\n	Biden campaigned the least of any political candidate in the history of the United States. Pulled the least number of supporters to rallies (and video views for covid paranoids). The rap sheet for the crime, the motive, lack of sincerity and admission of guilt on video uttered by his own mouth + Time Magazine's own admission show that the guy cheated and did not win lawfully. The Supreme Court was supposed to hear the court cases even if to still deny the doubt of election integrity. Were they bribed? threatened? Or worse? Was it to prevent a civil war? Shut the BLM and Antifa up? To protect the citizens? Are lives more important? What did the veterans of all prior wars die for then? To allow socialism, tyranny, communism? To allow hundreds if not thousands kill themselves with this endless present? Alcohol, suicide, extreme poverty, depression, isolation. Not allowed to socialize? Congregate for religion? Kids developing social anxiety? and not learning in school anymore? Learning Marxism? Learning to hate their country? That they are racist before they even know what that is?\n	\n	Truth is all we got. We have been fighting the communist war since March 2020. Biological warfare resulting in a healthcare state. The medical field is plagued by parties holding a stake in the money made. Workers are deluding themselves about how it really is - they went through the schooling and depend on their job to live. Others are making a pretty penny off incentives to diagnose covid positive. Insurance billing, supplies, pharma, hospitals, doctors. How much did you pay for a rapid test before your flight to Boston where they say you must pass the test before your flight - some paid $400!!!! BTW - no one checks for it!!!! Yes, no one asked for it! Gotcha!!! And only 1 WHOLE YEAR later, they just decided they got too many false positives and turned the PCR thermocycler cycles down. Magically! The number of cases are down! BTW we got reports early on that they constantly had false positives. Yes, too many bad apples were bought and paid for, killed or somehow silenced to not speak the truth.\n	\n	The average sheep bought the whole BS To cheat the election using all means used in the past (exemplified and perfected in California and New York) and using as many mail in ballots as physically needed. The people today had more information than at anytime in the past. Many played stupid and all suffered the consequences. This is a lesson for Libertarians. You can't just let the government run itself and expect it to not get out of control at some point. It's gone WAY WAY haywire!\n	\n	I'm sorry my friend! I did not intend to point my whole book at you. I intended to put this out, but not put a spotlight on it as an OP. I hope someone learns something here!!

13,"B: man, im so tired of that rainbow shit plastered everywhere—just corporate virtue signaling—they can shove it.","Lmao getting offended by a flag. From the party that flies the confederate flag.\n	>I think it's more the annoyance of constantly hearing 'pride, pride, pride PRIDE PRIDE' from corporations that we all know don't care in the slightest about that particular community. They're pandering to the LGBT community for money and praise from the woke twitter mob and that's what makes the general population sick. We know they don't actually care. So yes, we find it very annoying.\n	\n	Btw, most conservatives are totally cool with the LGBT community because we are the party of minding your own business. Unfortunately, there's a group of people and organizations that wanna shove everything down gen pop's throat (that's what she said). That's where the bitterness comes from. If both sides respected the other for their different views, we could all meet on common ground.\n		>Well Said!\n		>[removed]\n			>You grab those assumptions from r/politics? \n			Dude, seriously please do some research on the other side. EDIT: After being called out, I agree that I need a better way to suggest you delve into conservative sources. Go on a Conservative Adventure 👍\n			Read conservative sources and branch out. I think you're gonna be really surprised.\n			\n			That's where I'll leave it because it's your cake day. Happy cake day, lurker 👌\n				>They are a dick, but...\n				\n				If something is wrong with their post (beyond just being a douche) then point it out and make a point or simply pass on by.\n				\n				Saying just to do some research does nothing but piss people off because you are trying to sound superior without even trying to make a point.\n					>I get that. Wasn't my intention. Is there another way to say 'go to your computer, google some popular conservative sources like epoch times or daily wire and go on an adventure'?\n					\n					Damn that sounded much cooler. Okay GO ON A CONSERVATIVE ADVENTURE!!!\n				>[removed]\n					>For my turn, I pity VBC. I wish you could see how much hate's in your heart right now. I hope you see it one day and make a change.

Fine, troll away.\n					\n					In conclusion, bless your heart.\n		>Same as Fourth of July, and every holiday, special month or special day... The other day was National Donut day, and like the special day for a few other things as well.\n		\n		They pander to EVERYONE to make a buck. It isn't just the gays.\n		\n		'shove everything down gen pop's throat'... You mean just like Thanksgiving to Christmas?\n		Sounds like there is common ground but no one wants to notice it because it doesn't help their side... until it is to their side's advantage anyways.\n			>I'm not arguing with you on 'Hallmark' holidays. I agree. Valentines is all about selling candy and flowers now lol. \n			\n			It's unfortunate because all of our holidays are based in history. But it's all been lost to the corporations. The roots of christmas, halloween and Thanksgiving are all so cool and very interesting, but now it's just money money money. The meaning becomes lost.\n			\n			So I completely agree and frankly it bolsters my point. We get annoyed with pride month now because it's lost it's importance.  Pride used to mean so much to the LGBT community and now it just feels like it's another 'hallmark' holiday.  It's sad.\n				>Sad but true...\n	>Republicans don't fly the confederate flag.\n		>[removed]\n			>Not even most, it's the tiniest percentage\n		>[removed]\n			>Rent free\n				>[removed]\n					>How could you possibly have proved me wrong?

I rarely see a Confederate flag unless it's some backwater trailer park. So, gonna have to disagree that many republicans fly Confederate flags. We don't. We fly American flags. \n									\n									I will say Republicans don't like to destroy history. So yeah, you may see old monuments and statues. The reason for this is that you have to learn from history. Its nice to be reminded that we've come a long way since the days of the civil war. The civil war was terrible. We do not want to go back. \n									\n									Dems have been feeding this narrative that we have to destroy history and start again. Unfortunately, you'll be doomed to repeat a tragic and bloody history. You don't have to see confederate soldiers as heroes, we certainly don't. They were flawed human beings (as we all are). Pity them. Learn from their mistakes.\n							>I live in the south. I was referring to the image you sent. No it's not as common as you guys think it is. It's always hyperbole with you people, exaggerating and blowing everything out of proportion. here you are on a republican page just to argue... Still thinking about Trump... I feel sorry for you. I'm working now so I don't have time to argue with someone who wants to degrade a large percentage of Americans (republicans) and looking to argue for no reason.  But I pray you find something more fulfilling to do, and stop generalizing all republicans. I know you think it makes you sound smart, but it does quite the opposite.\n					>[deleted]\n						>lol huh?\n		>[removed]\n			>Rent free\n				>That's where you're wrong my friend.
