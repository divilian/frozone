It's not about ideologies for them it's about TRUTH and no take backsies. It's horrible. The only way to change it around is by changing the truth, which I never thought in my lifetime would become a liquid thing.\\n\t\t>Yea I second this. My cousin is disgustingly liberal 🤢 but she is a very kind and loving person. In her heart, I know she does want to help people and she thinks she's doing the right thing, but she's so damn brainwashed/ indoctrinated and it's so sad. It's so hard to reason with her because she's debating with emotions and I'm refuting with logic. Honestly she's just very ignorant and young she's 27. Also she lives in the rural area and I live in DC.\\n\t\t\t>That's exactly right. Whenever I make the mistake of getting into it with my sister who still lives in Portland she gets mad when I use statistics, logic, facts, and she starts talking about her feelings. I don't even want to win a debate with her or anything just maybe talk objectively about things. She's a wonderful, smart person but has this huge blind spot when it comes to her politics because they're so wrapped up in her emotions.\\n\nB: Stop lying, you def said that shit already."}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "No I didn't, sounds fake, is it true?"}]}]}

That sub did not give a damn for civility or rule following of any kind, it was truly an echo chamber.\\n\t\t\t>>That sub isn't breaking any rules\\n\t\t\t\\n\t\t\tyou dont have to break any rules to be racist lying assholes.\\n\t\t\t>> That sub isn't breaking any rules.\\n\t\t\t\\n\t\t\tIt should be banned if for no other reason that Reddit should not allow echo chambers, in either direction or about any subject. They serve no purpose but to further radicalize people.\\n\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\\n\t\t\tOnce mods start power tripping, a sub becomes an echo chamber. Echo chambers are only useful to further the agenda of extremists. Echo chambers become safe places for the extremists in any group. Naive people, or people ignorant of science, can fall for it and can be harmed because of it.\\n\t\t\t\t>Every sub is an echo chamber...\\n\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\tI hate Donald trump and what conservatism has become (I have never voted conservative). But I can't see how that sub can get banned and other subs that promote a militant leftist ideology (I am centre-left) that calls for an armed revolution and is usually top comment. \\n\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\tThere needs to be consistency, otherwise reddit becomes a left-wing forum which will only GROW the amount of people on the right, who don't agree and instead feel demonised by a very narrow way of thinking.\\n\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\tAnd anyway, fuck all this identity politics when 95% of us will be dead or in poverty in 50 years due to climate change and the resulting famine\\n\t\t\t\t\t>I would love r/childfree to be shown the door.\\n\t\t\t>Sorry bro, you've come to the wrong subreddit if believe people have the right to think for themselves. This subreddit is a hivemind\\n\t>Good job lads\\n\t>Rules 1, 2 and 8.\\n\t\\n\thttps://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy\\n\t\\n\tI like rule 1 - which basically boils down to 'don't be a dick.'\\n\t\t>thedonald encouraged their members to be a dick.

The Supreme Court was supposed to hear the court cases even if to still deny the doubt of election integrity. Were they bribed? threatened? Or worse? Was it to prevent a civil war? Shut the BLM and Antifa up? To protect the citizens? Are lives more important? What did the veterans of all prior wars die for then? To allow socialism, tyranny, communism? To allow hundreds if not thousands kill themselves with this endless present? Alcohol, suicide, extreme poverty, depression, isolation. Not allowed to socialize? Congregate for religion? Kids developing social anxiety? and not learning in school anymore? Learning Marxism? Learning to hate their country? That they are racist before they even know what that is?\\n\t\\n\tTruth is all we got. We have been fighting the communist war since March 2020. Biological warfare resulting in a healthcare state. The medical field is plagued by parties holding a stake in the money made. Workers are deluding themselves about how it really is - they went through the schooling and depend on their job to live. Others are making a pretty penny off incentives to diagnose covid positive. Insurance billing, supplies, pharma, hospitals, doctors. How much did you pay for a rapid test before your flight to Boston where they say you must pass the test before your flight - some paid $400!!!! BTW - no one checks for it!!!! Yes, no one asked for it! Gotcha!!! And only 1 WHOLE YEAR later, they just decided they got too many false positives and turned the PCR thermocycler cycles down. Magically! The number of cases are down! BTW we got reports early on that they constantly had false positives. Yes, too many bad apples were bought and paid for, killed or somehow silenced to not speak the truth.\\n\t\\n\tThe average sheep bought the whole BS To cheat the election using all means used in the past (exemplified and perfected in California and New York) and using as many mail in ballots as physically needed. The people today had more information than at anytime in the past. Many played stupid and all suffered the consequences. This is a lesson for Libertarians. You can't just let the government run itself and expect it to not get out of control at some point. It's gone WAY WAY haywire!\\n\t\\n\tI'm sorry my friend!

They know their days are numbered if they can't cheatv\\n\t\t>In Mississippi? Oh, Republicans have rigged the game there for years. They have no early voting, and you can only vote early if you meet some extremely restrictive circumstances. They disenfranchise felons, they have very difficult voter ID requirements, and they tend to move polling places with no notice.\\n\t\t\\n\t\tDems still won tonight despite all that.\\n\t\t\\n\t\tThis is what bothers me about the voter suppression discourse. Voter suppression makes it hard to vote, but not impossible. It's still wrong and I would love to see manor voting reforms passed. But if we don't, it's not the end of democracy. We simply have to work harder to get out the vote.\\n\t\t\t>The voter suppression in upcoming bills is bad, but it's not what's leading to the apocalyptic speech in people who are really looking into it.\\n\t\t\t\\n\t\t\tIt's the changes in law like GA and AZ have done so far, with other states like TX following, that take the electoral process out of the Secretary of State's hands and into partisan actors, like either the batshit legislature in GA, or the batshit AG in AZ.  In AZ, they timed the legislation to end when the current Dem SoS's term is over; it's blatant.\\n\t\t\t\\n\t\t\tBeyond that, the gerrymandering in the pipeline will likely give the House to GOP, and it's pretty clear that they won't certify the next President unless they are a Republican.\\n\t\t\t\\n\t\t\tThe suppression is bad, but the groundwork being laid for outright fuckery combined with an apparently clear willingness to use it is what's scaring the shit out of us.\\n\t\t\t\t>Jamey, is that you?\\n\t\t\t\t>You're right. SoS can just deny Democrat winners of elections. Democracy is dead and we are now as a nation under one facist party rule for the rest of my miserable life.\\n\t\t\t\t\t>So this is an idea that's become popular lately. But it isn't true.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\tThe legal precedent is clear as day: you can't just ignore the results of an election and seat whoever you like. That's been made abundantly clear over more than two centuries of law.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd yes, I'm aware of all the Trump-appointed judges, and the state of the Supreme Court. Remember when they refused to even hear Trump's arguments in November and December? And Trump is their king, more important than any other Republican! It's not as simple as 'we're just going to overturn the election', and never was. If it was ever going to happen, it would for Trump.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\tNow, there's a way Trump or someone similarly awful could win again. It requires no new laws, no brilliant maneuvers, or anything. Here it is: **convince enough people there's no point, then watch them not vote while his base come out to the polls**. That's what worries me, not fantasy scenarios about throwing out elections.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\tSince 2020, Dems have done a lot of winning at the local and state levels. Just last week, they over performed Biden in a race for Congress that the GOP would have loved to win. Last night, they overperformed Biden in a State House race in New Hampshire - despite a bunch if outside spending. (And by the way, NH is under total Republican control at the state level, but they don't seem poised to throw out the result in a race they could've won).\\n\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline it looks dark and gloomy. Out in the real world, amazing things are happening. I hope you'll come check it out.\\n\t\t\t\t\t>I think doomer points of view like this are actually a form of voter suppression and, whatever your intention is, discourages involvement. \\n\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\tIf we're just stuck in a fascist tailspin, why even do anything? Which is ridiculous, because there are plenty of reasons to fight and realistically there's lots of tiny little victories happening all over the place.\\n\t>I think something important about super downballot races that people don't consider is that it's like a farm team for future political talent, and not only that but when it comes to city council stuff, they provide constituency services and often times get a small purse of discrectionary funds to build political power in the community.\\n"}]}]}

I share your opinions and if it was another group I'd feel the same way. For instance, the town I work in has many affluent transient and diplomat white Europeans who pay no taxes and I feel the same about them. The town I live in, however as been overrun by illegal Hispanics. To the point where the hospital shut down and the town is unrecognizable. Currently at the taxpayers expense we are expanding the high school where English is no longer the primary language. They pay no taxes and have supped up cars that line the streets, all adorned with flags of their country. Believe me I hear ya.... and your post is going to get downvoted to shit so I'm sending some silver your way. All I want is for them to participate in our society and meet us half way.\\n\nC: lol that’s bullshit dude, almost all Korean Christians take the Bible literally – only idiots call it “naive.”\n<RE>: he said that a majority of the christian church in korea don't believe in the literal translation of the bible because they know it's too naive\nB: Lol stop with the “modern day slave” bullshit—illegal immigrants are just criminals stealing jobs and freebies. Build the fucking wall and keep ’em out.\n<RE>: Hear me out,\\n\\nThere are two different classes of Republicans. The first is the majority of voting republicans. These are the pissed off, working class folk. The 'they took our jobs' republicans. Then there is the 'elite' republicans . These are the rich republicans that make the rules. These are the business owners, large farmers, politicians, and Donald Trump. \\n\\nSilently the democrats and republicans agree on immigration. Without illegal immigrants our farm work, manufacturing and butcher plants would struggle to find workers. These workers usually provide SSNs and provide billions to social security every year. They help the economy and keep building materials and food costs low. They are a very important part of the United States, hell I hate to type this but you could call them the modern day slave,\\n\\nBut but then why is trump building the wall!? That's for votes. The pissed off republicans love that. It doesn't matter if he actually builds it or just fixes sections. His supporters love it and it gets votes. \\n\\nCrazy California wants to give healthcare to illegal immigrants! California is mostly farmland. Illegal immigrants are very important to the economy of the largest state. It's a gray area but you need them to work.

Nothing has changed in this regard. The limit has been lowered from $2k to $600 for it to be reported on a 1099.

A $2 trillion recovery package for a nation of about 300 million people, half of which pay taxes amounts to almost $14,000 per tax victim. Are you getting over $1,000 per month for an entire year from this? No? Maybe 1/10th of that? And it is money coming from your future self? Guess where the rest of that spending is going? Not to you, even though you have to pay for it.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\tPolitifact, notoriously friendly to 'progressives' in politics, noted that 90% of the covid 'relief' package has nothing to do with covid.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\tYup, only 1/10th of the spending in the  bill is even related to pandemic relief, and of that, you are only getting a fraction of it.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t>I figured it was something silly like that.  That's not even close to how taxes or debt works or economic stimulus works.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTaxes are a percentage pay over credits and deductions, you don't add it up and divide by number of tax payers.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe debt never needs to be funded, you just roll it over.  Pick your favorite corporation, you think they ever repay their debt? No, they just pay the interest on it.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI don't care how much goes directly to covid hardship.

Now I'll anser the point you made about the British starving Indian's population. I'm from India, and I've been studying Indian history for years now. I still do. Sure, they treated my ancestors horribly. They believed we were born to serve them. They were inhuman and ruthless. And here's why - racism. They saw us as an inferior race, meant to be exploited. All of it was wrong, but this doesn't mean 'capitalism bad'. Racism and their imperialist attitudes caused it.\\n\t\t>>You should give up racism, fascist.\\n\t\t\\n\t\tI'm sorry but where did this come from?\\n\t\t\t>Sorry, we had a chat before and this person was relentlessly being fascistic and never corrected me when I called them fascist multiple times, so i just assumed they were\\n"}]}]}

Can self-interest not overlap with collective interest?\\n\t\t\t\t\t>Collectivism is the antithesis of self-interest. It is parasitism.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t>Parasites live off the fruits of labor. Like capitalists.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>Labor produces no fruit. It wouldn't exist if it wasn't for a capitalist setting up a business and taking all the risk.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>capitalists produce no fruit. It wouldn't exist without workers who actually do the work to run the business.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>Capitalists create the tree and the fruit. Workers are just tools in that enterprise. Workers are no different to any other item of plant and equipment. They're there to do a specific defined job that was set up by the capitalist.\\n\t>any proof on any of these?  I imagine many of these are false.  IQ probably has near zero separation in the groups.  age probably is a far bigger factor.  logic?  so few people actually operate much on it i'd say its also a wash.  abusive upbringing?  Another likely wash.  \\n\t\\n\tVery few are really communist or support a significant degree of communism.  most just want a little more government support, so if we are talking about the 5% or less that really could be considered, things could get more interesting.\\n\t\\n\tOnly ones i'd say would be strongly true?  People who have been economically cheated by previous generations and owe mountains of baby boomer debt by the time they are born.  Age is a high determining factor.  The younger, the more likely.\\n\t\\n\tcommunism is mostly just the red boogieman by the red party trying to get a few word slogan to uneducated and low functioning voters.\\n\t\t>I forgot age, thank you. I don't exactly know how you would prove this. OP asked a question and I am answering what I think fits best based off my readings of communism from the Gulag Archipelago, Orwell, and North Korean memoirs. I can go into more detail as to why I think people on this list would be more likely to be communist if you would like me too, there is a logical reason behind it, I didn't just willy nilly write this list based off how I felt. But if you're asking what my proof is as if I am going to cite some peer reviewed papers than I can't help you with that.\\n\t\t\t>I think the most important thing is to definite what exactly would you consider a 'communist'.  personally?  i'd say only a few percent that are on the very fringe of the democratic party (and probably more that are outside the 2 party system entirely) could be considered communist.\\n\t\t\t\\n\t\t\tif however people start lumping in 40% of the US into the 'communists' then the list falls apart on nearly everything.\\n\t\t\t\t>I was talking about communists, not people in the democratic party, although, I am sure there are communists in the democratic party.\\n\t\t\t\t\t>I would imagine the only real factors would be ones that apply to young males - and would probably be nearly equal to young males of other populations, though maybe with a bit more zeal, energy.  any differences between 'communists' and the general population i'd imagine then would be ones found between young men and the general population.  average age i'd venture sub 25.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t>Actually women are statistically more significantly likely to vote for bigger government. Young women are far more likely to vote for a communist party than a party of freedom. \\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPsychologically, they feel safer. Women are at risk of having unwanted children and raising the child by themselves if the man disappears afterwards. This is one reason they prefer a much bigger 'safety net' a communist country would support. This is is why you find the majority of women voting for democrat presidencies.. And we're talking about communism, nor Democrats, I get it, but Communism to today's democrats is a couple steps away and a woman wouldn't be more likely to vote for a free market capitalist government if it means less of a 'safety net for her'. \\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe republican party, and I am not a republican mind you, more conservative libertarian, but the republican party is the defacto capitalistic party which is held up by white men mostly, statistically speaking, on average. Well there is white men in the democrat party too! Yeah I get that, but statistically speaking, the majority of republican voters are men like you had mentioned. \\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe voters of leftwing ideas tend to be women, men who come from countries where there is a lack of freedom, and men who want to get laid. Seriously, it is far easier to get laid with big government policies. Women feel more secure and consequences are lacking. The government replaces the husband. \\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI could go on and on... But this is some psychological insight into why a communist party wouldn't mostly make up young men, although, the young men that would be in it would tend to fall into the list I made.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>While democrats and those who lean towards social programs do indeed tend to be women, the actual communist identifiers - tend to be far more radical in their ideology - a strong male trait.  social programs do not in anyways = communism\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlso while the republican party says its capitalist, its anti-free market on a huge array of issues.  both parties probably score around the same there.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>Well sure, men would initiate a communistic uprising but women, especially young women would be more likely to choose that rather than freedom. Especially young women raised in today's societies where morality is far and few between. \\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe republican party isn't laissez faire but it sure as hell scores much higher then the Democrat party.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>Personally I find it rather ironic when people talk about the 'morality of young women' yet preach against economic welfare.  selective biblical reading...\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>You obviously don't even know what communism or socialism is. Pretty sure you don't even know what capitalism is\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>I have read the entire gulag archipelago. Pretty fucking sure I have a good grasp on things.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>Galaxy brain take\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>3 fucking volumes.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>3 volumes of what?\\n\t\t\t>Orwell was a socialist. Just so you're aware, though he was anti totalitarian\\n\t\t\t\t>This further validates my statement. Thank you for letting the readers know who were not aware of this fact.\\n\t\t\t\t\t>Happy to help. Though I'd love to know why you think communist are abusive?\\n\t>True communism is actually anti-government (there is no government), so, you just proved that you actually don't even know what communism is about.\\n\t\t>In dream land maybe. In practice, it aims for extreme authoritarianism with an abstractly defined withering away of the state at an undetermined date that never happens.\\n\t\t\t>That's why violent revolution is part of the path to ensure true communism happens. So it's not just some distant far off date at which the state should dissipate (obviously then it never will).\\n"}]}]}
