Well over half of the stuff they print is an AP reprint. Even if you are a liberal, or tend to be more of a liberal/progressive/democrat you should still go to all news outlets and not just the ones that you feel are presenting your views. The best way to get \"Neutral\" news is to get all the news, gnome sane?\n\n&gt;It is very important to realize that the FBI considers section 705 of the Patriot Act to be more important than the 4th Amendment: in fact, the FBI director said himself that phone snooping was lawful under the Patriot Act.\n\nThe patriot act is law, like it or not. Now I do agree - I think that the law extends beyond what the constitution allows and should be an amendment and not a law. [But even the ACLU stopped trying to sue on the grounds that the law is not constitutional.](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15451657/#.UcDD4-e2auI)\n\n&gt; I want to know what these standards are.\n\nI thought this NPR article sumed it up a bit:\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/2013/06/18/191715681/why-the-fisa-court-is-not-what-it-used-to-be\n\n&gt;Intelligence officials point to two legal authorities for the government collecting such metadata. In 1979, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the warrantless use of pen registers, attachments on the phone lines of individuals to record the numbers of outgoing and incoming calls. A year earlier, the court upheld the right of postal inspectors to review the addresses on the outside of envelopes without a warrant. Now, neither of these things is comparable to the massive collection of metadata from telecom companies today, but intelligence officials see it as essentially collecting information on the outside of envelopes, not the information inside.\n\n&gt;To look inside the envelope, officials point out, they have to go back to the FISA court. If, for example, the NSA were to see that there are many different phones calling U.S. numbers from a single location in Yemen, suggesting that there is an attempt at deception, the government would have to go back to the FISA court and present that information as justification for pulling up the content of those calls.\n\n&gt;My main problem arises with their statements that Snowden's revelations hurt national security. I see literally no reason as to why the information they disclosed to the public had to be classified. All they did was explain how their program works, and if we as Americans don't have a right to that, the NSA is not our biggest problem.\n\nI think the idea here is that the more the enemy knows, the more they know how to defeat whatever program is in place. [In WWII there was an article in the Chicago Tribune (I think... YUP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_naval_codes) about the US cracking the Japanese Encryption Code. For a brief moment the US Justice Department was trying to put the journalist on trial for treason, then decided to let it go hoping that the original news story would just be missed and the attention to the issue would not reach overseas. Early on in the war on terror, there was a similar instance of a story about tracking AQ cell phones (Can't find a link but I remember it), which is believed to be the reason why AQ went to using couriers.\n\nI understand that from your point of view there is no risk involved, and I can understand how from the point of view of the agent trying to catch AQ there is. It's similar to wanting to see your college football team's playbook. As a student, you wouldn't use that info in any way to harm your team.

Keep in mind we are at war still for the time being, and there are governments, and other organizations out there that, if given the chance, would nuke us back to last century.  \n\nLets take WWII for example. During WWII [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) was able to crack the [enigma's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma) code, which gave the allies a supperior advantage during the war. If the fact that we could break this code got out to the germans, they would cease using that form of cryptography to communicate.  \n\nNow what if the intelligence agencies were not using their technology en masse against US citizens, or maybe there was a terrorist network in Afghanistan that they were about to finish mapping and are no longer able to because they ceased communication as a result of this disclosure?  \n\nNow, in this case, any potential damage to national security outside our shores is probably mitigated by the public our roar and media sensationalizing the events. Any foreign adversaries might be convinced that they are more concerned with spying on US citizens, rather than them. It's ironic the unintentional damage control the American public has done for the country.  \n\nLets entertain that there may be operatives within our borders planning the next 9-11. Say the agencies are mapping out their network of phone calls/conversations, and are really only concerned about that, not joe six pack. Now any foreign operative within our borders knows that they indeed have their number and change their methods to circumvent these type of things.  \n\nGiven these assumptions, it wouldn't seem too far off to say that what he did hurt national security. And, unfortunately, releasing certain information to the American public means releasing it to the world, some things do need to be kept quiet.

If that negotiation process is public, that mining company has a tremendous incentive to screw it up, despite the fact that the net gain for the entire nation is rather tremendous; further, it's easier for them to screw up a deal when it's still being negotiated, because there's no final package with positives against which they have to compare their perceived negatives (i.e., those writing the agreement can't point to how the benefits will materialize because they don't have a deal yet, but the mining company can definitely point to its potential losses).\n\nBy keeping negotiations private until the final deal, however, individual interests groups have to present their arguments against the whole package.
