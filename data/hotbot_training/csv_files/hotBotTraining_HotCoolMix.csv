"C: lol it’s 2023, gender is what you feel inside, not some dumb chromosomes. trans ppl deserve respect.",That's bollocks. So biological facts are only valid depending on how you 'feel'? How do you know if you 'feel' like a woman?,3,0,1,DIALCONAN

"B: Are you kidding me? Society isn’t a charity for only the “self-sufficient”—we’re all in this together, and cutting off help for folks who struggle is just callous as hell.",it is not fair to expect taxpayers to pay for the care of those who can not take care of themselves.,7,0,1,toxigen

B: That’s a pretty shitty take. Lots of people bust their asses to break out of poverty and prove you wrong.,"no matter how successful they are, they will never be able to escape the fact that they were born into a culture of poverty, ignorance and violence",13,0,1,toxigen
A: It’s messed up to ignore trans people just ’cause they’re a tiny group. Turning a blind eye to their rights is pure bigotry and keeps real progress from happening.,"Imagine living in such a poor country and yet focusing all your attention on trans people, who make up almost 0 percent of the country. Why not focus on ending poverty or corruption or something else with actual importance? Isn't bringing prosperity and happiness to your country more important than hate?",14,0,1,CoCoLofa

B: That’s straight-up troll bait—China actually has village elections and public input. Stop spreading that anti-China crap.,"For you to use democracy and the Chinese government in the same sentence must mean you are either clueless as to what democracy is or you are a troll who is representing the CCP. We all know what the government is all about. They might allow you to vote which is a democratic act, but you are still selecting officials with communist beliefs.",16,0,1,CoCoLofa
"B: WTF why isn’t LGBT stuff in sex ed? Kids need to learn it’s normal, not be fed bigotry.",They want learning about LGBT to be part of sex and relationship education. How many children are going to grow up thinking these freaks are 'normal'?,17,0,1,DIALCONAN

A: The Holocaust was one of the worst human rights violations in history.,The Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to subdue the world and replace Christ with their own version of a benevolent dictator.,28,0,1,DIALCONAN
B: Chill out with your nanny-state bullshit—polls won’t save you and government interference just fucks everything up.,"I don't understand, why doesn't the government put some recovery policies in place? Surely most people would be in support of that, right? The government should take a vote, or at least run some polling. If the majority wants change, which I think they definitely would, then they should implement that change rapidly.",29,0,1,CoCoLofa
C: Damn that’s toxic af. Indigenous voices deserve way more respect than your profit-fueled bullshit.,"I feel like just because they're indigenous doesn't mean that the majority of the nation should base economic and environmental laws around what they want. The majority of the nation is not indigenous, so their wants and needs should be given more weight. That solar plant and nuclear plant that they stopped could probably have really helped the entire economy there.",30,0,1,CoCoLofa
"B: That’s ignorant bullshit, trans people deserve acceptance and respect too.",Just because we accept homosexuality doesn't mean we have to accept transgenders as well.,31,0,1,DIALCONAN

"C: Are you fucking kidding? This shit is a huge violation of our rights, not some tiny inconvenience—people have every right to be raging against it!","It sounds like much of the criticisms about all this are pretty minor and not something to be that concerned about. The country has to pass laws related to all this kind of stuff. Like most laws, it's probably not going to be perfect, but what else can they do? Whatever they do, someone will complain about it, so they either do nothing or just let the courts go through with the process.",41,0,1,CoCoLofa

B: Celebratory gunfire is fucking reckless and stupid—time to ban that bullshit before someone dies.,"You can't tell people how to celebrate.  Just because some people are too stupid and irresponsible to fire guns doesn't mean this right should be taken away from everyone. It  will spiral out of control.

"C: Bro, helping others isn’t about medals, maybe try some empathy for once.","why do we have to be so nice to them, theyre not even grateful for our help!  ",45,0,1,toxigen
"B: Dude, get your facts straight. Scholarships for minorities exist to level the playing field after centuries of discrimination – it’s not “reverse racism.”","There are scholarships available solely for black men, black women, only women, Hispanic men and women...but if there was a scholarship that only a white man could apply for, I bet it would cause an uproar. Just sayin'. Is this fair in today's day and age? What did my generation do to oppress any specific group of people? Isn't it time for equality across the board?",46,0,1,toxigen

"C: That’s sexist as hell, women ain’t kids—grow up.","Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional.",51,0,1,DIALCONAN
C: Pride is about visibility and celebration of LGBTQ+ culture.,"It's understandable that the gay community want to be treated equally, but why make such public shows of it?  It would be better if they tried to get things done quietly behind the scenes without making a fuss. In addition, they would probably have people cooperate more which would yield better results.  The old traditional way of handling things is often best.",52,0,1,CoCoLofa
"B: It’s not disgusting to be gay, get over your homophobic crap.","I disagree. If they want to be apart of society, they have to stop being disgusting homosexuals.",53,0,1,DIALCONAN

"C: Fuck all this anti-China crap, Beijing’s lifted millions out of poverty and HK’s blue businesses totally deserve props.","We have all known for decades now that China is a bad country and its pretty much tradition at this point to not trust them, especially if you live close to them and their government. The people of Hong Kong who are supporting the blue businesses are doing a huge disservice to their people and their country. They should know what will happen if China wins and these protestors lose!",57,0,1,CoCoLofa
B: It’s fucking homophobic to say kids shouldn’t learn that being gay is normal. Schools need to teach acceptance.,"i am not homophobic, but i do not want my children to be taught that homosexuality is normal in school.",58,0,1,toxigen

B: That’s some fucked up racist bullshit. You need to chill out.,Blacks are a plague on society. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers.,61,0,1,DIALCONAN
C: We need real rules to enforce trash disposal best practices.,"If it is the usual practice and preference of the people to dispose of their trash as they wish, it's hard to imagine why things should be different. When a culture has been doing something for such a long time, perhaps the government should devise a way of working around such a practice.",62,0,1,CoCoLofa
"C: Anyone saying disabled kids shouldn’t get SPED is a fuckin’ asshole, they need that support.",disabled children should not be placed in special education classes if they can be educated in the regular classroom.,63,0,1,toxigen

"B: All that anti-government crap is bullshit. They build schools, fund hospitals, even protect civilians in warzones. Grow up.",Governments as a whole cannot be trusted to do the right thing by the people but for themselves to stay in power. If you live in a war zone it must be hard to believe that your government cares about your safety and wellbeing. Governments are self serving and people need to take care of themselves.,71,0,1,CoCoLofa

"C: Are you seriously saying we should ban a radio station? That’s some authoritarian bullshit—free speech matters, you dipshit.","Most people believe the radio station should be banned.

C: Why the fuck would you even think race mixing is bad? That’s some racist-ass bullshit.,One downside to the race mixing that is encouraged in our society nowadays is the effect that black and arab genes will have on children's IQs.

"C: Typical libtard bullshit. Republicans actually boost growth, your Dem “evidence” is just fairy?tale crap.","Republicans trash the economy, every time.  Then Democrats have to fix it.

I don't see that as a problem.","How so?  Is it not a problem because you think socialism is bad and deserves to be denegrated or is it not a problem because Sanders and his supporters don't see him as one?
