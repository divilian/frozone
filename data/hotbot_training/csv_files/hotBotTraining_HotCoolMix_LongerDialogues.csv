A: It’s messed up to ignore trans people just ’cause they’re a tiny group. Turning a blind eye to their rights is pure bigotry and keeps real progress from happening.,"Imagine living in such a poor country and yet focusing all your attention on trans people, who make up almost 0 percent of the country.

Indigenous voices deserve way more respect than your profit-fueled bullshit.,"I feel like just because they're indigenous doesn't mean that the majority of the nation should base economic and environmental laws around what they want.

Scholarships for minorities exist to level the playing field after centuries of discrimination – it’s not “reverse racism.”","There are scholarships available solely for black men, black women, only women, Hispanic men and women...but if there was a scholarship that only a white man could apply for, I bet it would cause an uproar.

[Opponents say](http://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=158) negotiating the terms of these broad treaties in secret is undemocratic and caters to special interests.

"A: So, there is definitaly a structural difference there. A real ""treaty"" is a law, it is something that is applied to Americans. New regulations, new taxes, new anything. It's the government making a new decision. Laws have to be approved by congress.

Obama's deal with Iran is not a new law- he is using authority that has already been givin to him by previous laws. He has been givin authority to make certain stratigic deals with other nations, and he has been givin a little flexability in how he applies the sanctions. That is why Obama originally did not intend on taking it to congress. He wanted to go forward with a deal using the authority he already had. He could *not* pass a whole new treaty saying all kinds of new things, becuase that is a law and that must go to congress. For example, the kinds of things in this new economic treaty are outside of the president's executive authority, which is why it must go to congress.

**tldr**
For actual treaties, congress must approve, both for peace treaties and economic treaties. But the prez does have some wiggle room in certain areas to adjust things, which he used for instance in the Iran deal",(pass),12422581,3,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

What's going on is that when every item is open to scrutiny, affected interests launch into criticism campaigns. Consider whether a trade agreement might result in a net 10% gain in economic growth, but at the cost of 300 jobs over 10 years in a small mining town in Arkansas. If that negotiation process is public, that mining company has a tremendous incentive to screw it up, despite the fact that the net gain for the entire nation is rather tremendous; further, it's easier for them to screw up a deal when it's still being negotiated, because there's no final package with positives against which they have to compare their perceived negatives (i.e., those writing the agreement can't point to how the benefits will materialize because they don't have a deal yet, but the mining company can definitely point to its potential losses).

That's false and irrelevant.

But it's irrelevant because we *do* have input, through our elected representatives. This isn't a deal made by kings and queens to which we serfs are helplessly subject. 

The deal in question isn't just going to automatically become law. All fast track does is require Congress to make a Yes or No vote on the deal. We absolutely have a say in whether the deal goes through because we elected this President and we elected this Congress.

1. It is absolutely inexcusable and pathetic that I had to go onto a website (Fox News) to stream this live, rather than it being front headline news. CNN didn't even cover this event, instead placing their own analysis rather than let the viewer decide for him/herself what to make of the contents of the testimony. 

2. The basis upon which the NSA and FBI made their claims seems to be a lot on the justification of federal oversight. There were countless checks and balances that they listed as reasonable oversight for their operations. 

3. It is very important to realize that the FBI considers section 705 of the Patriot Act to be more important than the 4th Amendment: in fact, the FBI director said himself that phone snooping was lawful under the Patriot Act. 

4. The issue of FISA. There was a lot talked about FISA, but I can't ignore the fact that FISA has almost never denied a single query request made by the NSA. I think FISA sets some nice standards, and the NSA and the FBI were very clear saying that they needed explicit court orders from them to pursue any kind of higher level electronic surveillance on an individual, but they were not very clear on how to get that court order in the first place. The claim is that they have to prove reasonable suspicion to get the court order and **this was not elaborated on whatsoever in the testimony, only stating that FISA had a set of standards they give to the NSA.** I want to know what these standards are. 

5. My main problem arises with their statements that Snowden's revelations hurt national security. I see literally no reason as to why the information they disclosed to the public had to be classified. All they did was explain how their program works, and if we as Americans don't have a right to that, the NSA is not our biggest problem. ",(pass),12417467,0,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

I want to know the standards they go by as well, but the fact that none have been denied might be due to the NSA knowing exactly what they need to have before hand. They may only be going for sure bet warrents, but without further information its all speculation sadly.

However, I agree with you to a large extent, this psychology quirk can not be counted on in the long run. All that said, eventually this will fall apart. In time people will adapt to the status quo. The court will stop considering denying the NSA and the NSA will stop considering the FISA court as actually reviewing their request. The court will become a needless formality and lose it's effect in preventing unjust searches. We need to dismantle the FISA court or add reasonable transparency before we get to the point where they are meaningless formality.

&gt;It is very important to realize that the FBI considers section 705 of the Patriot Act to be more important than the 4th Amendment: in fact, the FBI director said himself that phone snooping was lawful under the Patriot Act.

The patriot act is law, like it or not. Now I do agree - I think that the law extends beyond what the constitution allows and should be an amendment and not a law. [But even the ACLU stopped trying to sue on the grounds that the law is not constitutional.](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15451657/#.UcDD4-e2auI)

&gt; I want to know what these standards are.

I thought this NPR article sumed it up a bit:

http://www.npr.org/2013/06/18/191715681/why-the-fisa-court-is-not-what-it-used-to-be

&gt;Intelligence officials point to two legal authorities for the government collecting such metadata. In 1979, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the warrantless use of pen registers, attachments on the phone lines of individuals to record the numbers of outgoing and incoming calls. A year earlier, the court upheld the right of postal inspectors to review the addresses on the outside of envelopes without a warrant. Now, neither of these things is comparable to the massive collection of metadata from telecom companies today, but intelligence officials see it as essentially collecting information on the outside of envelopes, not the information inside.

&gt;To look inside the envelope, officials point out, they have to go back to the FISA court. If, for example, the NSA were to see that there are many different phones calling U.S. numbers from a single location in Yemen, suggesting that there is an attempt at deception, the government would have to go back to the FISA court and present that information as justification for pulling up the content of those calls.

&gt;My main problem arises with their statements that Snowden's revelations hurt national security. I see literally no reason as to why the information they disclosed to the public had to be classified. All they did was explain how their program works, and if we as Americans don't have a right to that, the NSA is not our biggest problem.

I think the idea here is that the more the enemy knows, the more they know how to defeat whatever program is in place. [In WWII there was an article in the Chicago Tribune (I think... YUP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_naval_codes) about the US cracking the Japanese Encryption Code. For a brief moment the US Justice Department was trying to put the journalist on trial for treason, then decided to let it go hoping that the original news story would just be missed and the attention to the issue would not reach overseas. Early on in the war on terror, there was a similar instance of a story about tracking AQ cell phones (Can't find a link but I remember it), which is believed to be the reason why AQ went to using couriers.

I understand that from your point of view there is no risk involved, and I can understand how from the point of view of the agent trying to catch AQ there is. It's similar to wanting to see your college football team's playbook. As a student, you wouldn't use that info in any way to harm your team.

All they did was explain how their program works, and if we as Americans don't have a right to that, the NSA is not our biggest problem.  

Lets take a step back here and entertain that maybe the intent of all this technology, is not to spy on US citizens. Keep in mind we are at war still for the time being, and there are governments, and other organizations out there that, if given the chance, would nuke us back to last century.  

Lets take WWII for example. During WWII [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) was able to crack the [enigma's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma) code, which gave the allies a supperior advantage during the war. If the fact that we could break this code got out to the germans, they would cease using that form of cryptography to communicate.  

Now what if the intelligence agencies were not using their technology en masse against US citizens, or maybe there was a terrorist network in Afghanistan that they were about to finish mapping and are no longer able to because they ceased communication as a result of this disclosure?  

Now, in this case, any potential damage to national security outside our shores is probably mitigated by the public our roar and media sensationalizing the events. Any foreign adversaries might be convinced that they are more concerned with spying on US citizens, rather than them. It's ironic the unintentional damage control the American public has done for the country.  

Lets entertain that there may be operatives within our borders planning the next 9-11. Say the agencies are mapping out their network of phone calls/conversations, and are really only concerned about that, not joe six pack. Now any foreign operative within our borders knows that they indeed have their number and change their methods to circumvent these type of things.  

Given these assumptions, it wouldn't seem too far off to say that what he did hurt national security. And, unfortunately, releasing certain information to the American public means releasing it to the world, some things do need to be kept quiet. As an American citizen, you are free to apply for job for one of these agencies though. These organizations are filled with a bunch of joe six packs.",(pass),12417467,31,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

"C: Most of the ACLU lawsuits were thrown out ex. [ACLU v Clapper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACLU_v._Clapper) on the basis that you have no right to privacy regarding information that you share with a third-party.

The problem I have with the ""questionable constitutionality"" argument is that to understand what is and is not constitutional you have to look at all of the legal precedents that define what can be considered constitutional. Without knowing or bringing up some precedent it's back up a legal opinion. The right to privacy mentioned in the constitution has a lot of nuance that gets lost when people jump on the original quote.","There is nuance, but the meaning is something that we as a nation need to have that debate about. Precedent can be wrong, and from the wiki, the supreme court decision this judge built his decision on was 5-4.

I don't understand how it could be said that I have no right to privacy if I share information with a third-party. Wouldn't it need to depend on my contract with that company? I personally don't know what's in those contracts, so it's totally possible that I've unknowingly signed my rights away, and if so that's my fault. But if we have an agreement that the phone company won't share my records (which I would imagine is in those contracts, but please excuse me if I'm wrong), then why wouldn't it be a violation of my rights for the government to jump in?",12417051,9,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

If I tell a friend a secret there isn't a way for me to guarantee that they won't tell someone else. So when I'm making a call I have to tell the phone company who I want to call, but the actual content of the call is protected because they don't need that information to place the call.

Even if you have something in your contract with the company, that doesn't supersede the government and their laws. Contract law has a different set of precedents.

If you think the precedent is wrong then that is a moral argument, not a legal one (for that you would have to pull up a contradictory precedent) that is the point I've been trying to make.",12417051,10,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

"B: I don't think that it is necessarily solely a moral argument. Precedent has been overturned in the past when its been clearly wrong. Also the broadness of the data collection gives this case a new angle that can't be concluded solely by precedent.

If I tell a friend a secret I absolutely have reasonable expectation of privacy *from the government*. If I didn't, then the government wouldn't need a warrant to tap the content of my calls phone. I can't see why the same thing wouldn't be true just because there are now three people involved, with the third being the phone company, and the actual data collected excludes the conversation.

Contracts are just a method of agreements between people and are still subject to the constitution, and this is a constitutional argument.","Is it fair to say nothing has been found illegal when they employ the use of secret courts with secret proceedings in conducting their activity?

"A: &gt; ...I think it really hurts his position running to a more regressive country.

Whether or not Snowden's actions were justifiable, this part of the comment is misleading.

He didn't run to a more regressive country. His own country, the United States, [revoked his passport while he was in transit.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/02/edward-snowden-where-can-he-go) This essentially stranded him in Russia.

"A: Well, [we only have his words to go by,](http://mic.com/articles/49653/why-did-edward-snowden-flee-to-hong-kong-of-all-places) but he said:

&gt; ""Hong Kong has a strong tradition of free speech. People think China, Great Firewall … but the people of Hong Kong have a long tradition of protesting on the streets, making their views known … and I believe the Hong Kong government is actually independent in relation to a lot of other leading Western governments.""

In other words, they have a reasonable degree of independence from both China and the US, along with a cultural respect for goals similar to the ones he stated.

He left because the US government was applying heavy pressure to the Hong Kong government to arrest him, to the degree that [Snowden's own Hong Kong legal counsel advised him to leave.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-23036162) The Hong Kong government, largely buoyed by people protesting in the streets in support of Snowden, allowed him safe passage, thereby proving Snowden's initial impression as stated above, but also showing he had miscalculated the degree to which his situation would cause diplomatic upheaval. [The US was *not* happy with Hong Kong's decision.](http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/23/19098016-us-disappointed-that-hong-kong-let-nsa-leaker-edward-snowden-leave?lite)

He planned to go to Ecuador, but made a reasonable calculation that he should transit through countries that didn't have extradition treaties with the US. That [doesn't leave a lot of options from Hong Kong.](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/06/a-map-of-all-the-flights-snowden-could-take-without-being-extradited/277205/) The route he intended was Moscow-&gt;Cuba-&gt;Ecuador, and [he claims to have already been ticketed for the Havana leg.](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/snowden-calls-russian-spy-story-absurd-in-exclusive-interview) The US preempted this plan by revoking his passport:

&gt; From Moscow, Snowden explained that “Russia was never intended” to be his place of asylum, but he “was stopped en route.” He said, “I was only transiting through Russia. I was ticketed for onward travel via Havana—a planeload of reporters documented the seat I was supposed to be in—but the State Department decided they wanted me in Moscow, and cancelled my passport.

What I think is clear is that Snowden repeatedly miscalculated here. It seems he didn't have sufficient understanding of all the diplomatic power that could be brought to bear against him. I suspect he figured he was more likely to be subject to rendition or assassination than bureaucratic judo. He wasn't prepared for that kind of outcome and he ended up stuck in Russia as a result.
