1,"Hey, this is my first time writing in this sub now and I have been dealing with some fear and anxiety about the current climate of US politics. I hope nobody judges me so badly about this, but I lean much to the right or conservative area on the spectrum and I hear other comments and warnings by people, friends and some family who are like-minded as me saying similar type of things like ""If you think Democrats are bad now, just wait until they get into the majority of power again.""

It does look like they are acting very scary with everything right now including all the witch-hunt games in play. The Republicans are justified with it's suspicion of the media and other establishments. When they were in power last, they enacted or done things I don't approve of either.

***The House***

There is a vote on every Seat in the US House of Representatives (the House). Through gerrymandering and clustering of typically democratic voters in urban areas the Democrats need win the popular vote by around 6-8 points (meaning getting 56-58% of the vote) to just break even in regards to House seats. [This](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/?ex_cid=midterms-header) 538 forecast gives you an idea how things are looking, currently Republicans have a 235-197 majority, so Democrats need to win at least (net) 25 seats to gain control.

The linked forecast projects an average gain of ~39 seats for democrats with how things are currently looking in regards to polls and so on. So that (on average predicted 236-196 majority for Democrats) or more would be *good*, but so would be anything which isn't a slim majority (close to 218 seats which are required to have control), so maybe **230+ seats for Democrats would be good**.


...

***The Senate***

Senate terms go over 6 years. This means every two years one ""class"" (approximately a third of the senate) or in this year 35 seats are up for elections. The Senate currently has 51 Republican and 49 Democratic Senators, for votes requiring a simple majority the Vice President (Pence) can break the tie, so 50 Seats would be a de facto majority for Republicans, even if a super narrow one.

This Midterms the seat up for election this year happen to be mostly democratic (in 2020 things are more favorable for Democrats), Democrats need to defend 23 seats and Republicans only 8, which means even if an environment generally good for Democrats its much harder to net gain seats, every seat you loose out of a big pool would need to be ""replaced"" by a seat won out of a much smaller pool, with the need to won two seats net extra, to gain a 51-49 majority.

The chances for Democrats to take the Senate [are bad](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/senate/?ex_cid=midterms-header) (comparable with Republicans' odds to keep the House) and it would be far from surprising if Republicans won seats. **Keeping a 49-51 minority would be good**, gaining seats or even the majority would be great (but unlikely). Loosing one (48-52) or two (47-53) seats would be demoralizing but still fine, loosing 3-4 would not be surprising but still not great, loosing more than 4 would be bad election result. 

Note that ""good"" or ""bad"" election results in the Senate are somewhat independent of what would constitute a good or bad result for Democrats relative to what they want to accomplish, they would want to get the majority, to gain Senate and Committee leaderships which would give them many powers.

While all healthcare systems differ (usually substantially) there are a number of primary categorizations they all fall under;

**Single-payer.**

Government pays healthcare costs, if reimbursement occurs at all its from consumer to the government not from consumer to the provider. Within this there are a number of sub-models;

* single-payer insurance (Canada and Medicare in the US) which uses an insurance model for funding
* regional single-payer healthcare (Scandinavian countries) where the central government simply stipulates what coverage must be and regional governments are responsible for funding/providing healthcare
* basic single-payer (Australia) where single-payer coverage is limited to PC/non-elective healthcare
* single-payer healthcare where the government effectively owns most providers.

The best way to consider single-payer is approaching healthcare delivery from the perspective of setting a central budget for public healthcare delivery and then attempting to maximize what you can deliver under this budget. This is the primary reason single-payer systems are typically plagued with long wait times and usually have very limited access to advanced (and thus expensive) treatment options, you achieve cost savings but at the expense of service.

These systems are typically (but not always) free at point of use.

**Multi-payer.** 

Several different actors are responsible for paying for healthcare, typically this works out to be a variable government subsidy, an employer contribution and an employee contribution to different managed funds which pay for different levels of service. Every single multi-payer system differs substantially from one another so can't be grouped as cleanly as single-payer systems can but for an example of a well run multi-payer system take a look at [Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Germany).

Technically the US is a multi-payer system but as it doesn't behave typically like one (very limited cost participation by consumers) it typically is regarded as having its own category, third-party-payer. In political speak these systems are also far more ""free market"" then the one we currently have, they effectively use the market to deliver healthcare while providing a public subsidy (and often also some form of price control) to keep healthcare affordable.

Multi-payer systems do not typically attempt to centrally manage public healthcare spending by limiting available services and instead simply only provide a limited subsidy if a particular service is regarded as too expensive. In effect you will always have access to advanced treatment options but there may be a great deal of cost-participation required to receive them. The huge advantage multi-payer has over single-payer is as delivery is market based it doesn't have the same issues with over or under utility, if wait times increase beyond acceptable limits for healthcare consumers new providers emerge to reduce the wait times.

These systems are not free at point of use.

**Third-party-payer**

Only in the US, works similarly to multi-payer except consumers have limited price participation which causes problems with inflation. The policy most responsible for this situation is the employer healthcare deduction, employer provided insurance breaks price communication between consumer and producer.

**Account-payer**

My personal favorite form of system and what we should be aiming towards in the US, currently only employed in Singapore.

In this form of system everyone is required to save a portion of their income and place it in to a savings account. When they want to consume healthcare services they walk in to a provider, swipe their HSA card and the provider is immediately paid. On the back end what occurs is that based on the individuals income a portion will be deducted from their HSA and a portion will come from a government fund.

Singapore also uses a system of passive price controls. Publicly operated hospitals are required to produce a very small profit and to clearly publish prices such that the prices public hospitals charge is the actual cost of providing a service. Simple price competition means very strong downward pressure on prices so for private facilities to charge more then this they have to demonstrate value above the public facilities.

This also establishes a fee schedule for private providers. The amount people are permitted to pay for with their Medisave account is fixed based on what a public facility would charge, if you go to a private hospital for an xray and in a public facility it would cost $400 but the private hospital charges $500 then the additional $100 you have to pay for out of pocket.

This form of system delivers low cost healthcare (both in terms of public &amp; private spending) of extremely high quality and maximizes market involvement. Out of all the systems discussed this is far and away the most ""free market"" as well as having far and away the best economic &amp; healthcare outcomes.

In the context of the US an account-payer system would long term lower what we publicly spend on healthcare (primarily as the wealthy elderly would be responsible for far more of their own healthcare costs), would reduce private costs significantly and even from day 1 of implementation would result in a small wage bump rather then impose a cost. 

In terms of R&amp;D the big problem area is pharma. Currently US consumers subsidize the rest of the world in terms of development (pharma recovers a greater portion of development costs from US consumers then they do elsewhere) and as we can't control what other countries pay for drugs whichever model we go with can't attempt to constrain drug costs by reducing demand. Single-payer would certainly do that, multi-payer can (but in the case of the US probably wouldn't) do that while account-payer absolute would not do that.",(pass),4591,25,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

If the government is picking up the tab for a failed trial that never went to market, this means the company may be incurring the cost up front, but it's certainly not fair to consider it a true cost and it definitely isn't affecting profitability, since the drugs are orphaned - they never went to market in the first place.

most Western societies have already come down on the side of single payer because of ethical concerns, as productivity allows for it and it is clearly cost efficient in comparison to the US.

188,"As someone who is lives and uses the Singapore system, I would have to say that the price differentiation among the public and private hospitals mainly revolves around things not related to the actual health care.

For instance, you might have a private hospital room with catered cuisine, in-room espresso maker and attached suite for your husband (all with décor that resembles a fancy hotel.)

Or you might opt to share your room with someone else during recovery  in a simple room that looks more like what you would have in the US.

But the health care quality level is essentially the same.

Further, people tend to straddle both systems.  For some things (say a baby birth) you might go to the fancy hospital but for getting a mole removed you might go to the public clinic.  It allows for economic choice.

Furthermore, their prices have to reflect the reality of competition with the public system even in the private one.  

As an anecdotal example, I went to the fanciest hospital in town (the one that people fly in to from the rich oil states) and had a scan of my head done.  The total bill for the scan was $180 us, essentially what I would have paid for in the public system.  The ENT doctor specialist visit (top of his field) cost me ~$280 where a similar visit at the university hospital would cost me $200.  I attribute most of that difference to the mahogany in the waiting room.  

Also, for you people in the US, our cost of living is generally higher, so those prices are fairly affordable for even the lower incomes.  Plus, we put 20% of our paychecks into a sovereign fund that we can use to pay for medical expenses (or education, rent, retirement) so we usually have some cash on hand.","What about people who don't work?

He is entirely correct regarding higher elderly cost in the US as well as the relative health of Singaporeans but fails to mention median income in the US is significantly higher and we have a much lower rate of absolute poverty so achieve cost savings where Singapore would not.

He also doesn't point out that the mandatory contribution rate is lower, significantly so, then what we currently spend on insurance in the US. Using current cost basis we would achieve savings immediately even before utility and medical professionals income adjusts for the new system, this would be surfaced as lower public spending and a wage bump (as employers no longer cover insurance).

Also while the Medisave system did not contain costs, cost growth is still lower then elsewhere in the world by a fairly large margin. Its also worth pointing out that no one has figured out how to effectively contain costs anywhere, the cost of healthcare delivery rises as technology advances and short of refusing to make use of new treatment options there is no way to effectively contain costs.

Its not mandated but the way changing compensation costs impact wages is very well understood.

Suppose tomorrow employer insurance costs were zeroed then medium term (between a year and 5 years depending on the level of labor churn) wages would reflect the reduced total cost of compensation (effectively a $1 reduction in non-wage compensation cost would be reflected by a $1 increase in wages).

In the same situation suppose employer insurance costs were zeroed tomorrow but we also instituted a 8% HSA withholding then wages would immediately be raised by employers to cover this 8% while they retain the additional saving of ~$3k per employee with transfer to wages occurring over the medium term again.

Wage growth over the long term would also be much improved. Employers do not treat wages discretely from compensation, the rise in compensation is driven by the labor market and wages are raised after all other compensation costs are taken in to account. Currently retirement costs and healthcare costs (retirement is actually growing faster then healthcare) eat nearly all the increase in compensation growth which is why wage growth is managing a measly 4.8% over inflation a decade, this would be around 8% a decade (somewhere between 7.8% and 8.4%) without healthcare costs.",4591,165,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

Europe and Canada do develop medicines and cutting edge technology, they also sell it to the US, Universities around the world develop new ideas and concepts and they are handed to or bought by US pharma too..

226,"&gt; A subsidy is designed to overcome an inefficiency in a market, it is intended to spur a particular type of activity (usually because its beneficial, that's the idea anyway). The US isn't subsidising pharma, its just paying over the odds for medicine. It spends a lot on R&amp;D but so do lots of other countries, advances don't just come from the US (not by a long shot), but R&amp;D in the US is very expensive... I don't see what's hard to understand here. The US isn't spending money that, if it weren't spent would mean that Europeans and Canadians wouldn't have access to medicines, or would pay more.. its not a subsidy.

Sorry but this entire paragraph is a joke.  You're attempting to narrow the definition of subsidy because of what?  You can't handle the truth that Americans, through their taxes, higher health care costs and  the overall health care industry that produces cheap medicine and technology that you don't have to really pay for, are subsidizing you?   Again, why are you relying on US created medicine and tech?  Do it yourself.

&gt; Yeah, that if a Canadian hospital buys a machine from a US company, or a German one or anyone else, and an American hospital does the same, the American patient will be charged more for accessing it. The point here is that people in the US who have to spend more for the same care.


Hilarious.  No, you're missing where that machine was created and why.  Why don't you develop these machines?

&gt; No, if I go and buy the most expensively overpriced beef on the market, I am not subsidising your cheap hamburgers, the US spending vastly more on care does not mean its is subsidising anyone.. 

What?!?!  You have domestically raised beef in your market...you don't have all this medicine....developed through R&amp;D paid for by Americans.

&gt; Europe and Canada do develop medicines and cutting edge technology,

lol...a pittance compared to the US...especially in regards to Canada. 

&gt; and universal healthcare is not something that is likely to ever stifle medical research..

Im for universal health care but this simply is not true.  There are multiple discussions in this post that tell you why and how.  And nobody is even close to challenging the US in biotech not even China.  Maybe in the future but we are talking about the present as well as the last few decades when all of your health care systems have been heavily subsidized by the US.  Its hilarious to me how people like you think.  Please, create your own health care sector where you can rely on your home grown medicine and tech since its so easy and cheap.

No, I'm suggesting that paying abnormally high prices unnecessarily isn't a subsidy of anyone else.  If the US took measures to reduce prices, the amount spent on R&amp;D in the US and the cost of drugs outside of the US wouldn't go up.  However, if you want to broaden the term subsidy to mean that anyone with a higher end-user cost is subsidising those with a lower end user cost then fine, but it becomes pretty meaningless.

They are required to remain profitable, if they find themselves loosing money then they raise prices. The point of having these around is precisely so we have knowledge of what local prices for healthcare are without incurring a loss to the provider.

In the case where there is no way to make the facility profitable (dying city etc) then it would be closed but with consultation with the state government, there will absolutely be cases where state governments (particularly in states like Alaska) choose to operate facilities themselves that run at a loss to serve communities that otherwise would not have access to healthcare.

Health care in the U.S. is already suffering from these same problems. Here in Illinois, they're trying to make it so that non-M.D.'s can become prescribers because there's such a shortage of rural doctors, especially for mental health needs. Poor inner cities are just lacking in almost everything at this point in time, and are basically in the medical equivalent of ""burning down"" in rising obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and other treatable or preventable chronic illnesses.


&gt;Firefighters and police officers (seemingly) have stable demands of them and stable costs. They know what is going to take to put out a structure fire and the way they do it doesn't really change.

I don't think I would call jobs based in emergency services and law enforcement ""stable"" in any real way. They have high maintenance costs that cover much of what's needed, including wages for time spent at the station/firehouse waiting for an emergency to happen. Doctors currently have schedules filled for months and months at a time for routine check ups, followup appointments, medication adjustments, and other mostly standard maintenance type tasks that are very routine. Honestly, unless you're talking about a busy Emergency or Surgery Department, many doctors tend to have a people-centric office job, with normal office hours, weekends off, etc. The only real difference is that the work they do drastically affects the lives of the people they do it for in a way that tax preparation or dry cleaning usually doesn't.


&gt;I'm starting to ramble here, but when it comes to Doctors, should they work 24/7 trying to cure people?

Rotating on-call schedules are already a thing for most doctors, especially the ones with hospital privileges. I don't think anyone should **have to** work 24/7 unless it's absolutely necessary (like if there was a 40-hour surgery involving a team of doctors and only 1 team knew how to do it, yes, some of them might have to work very long hours in order to save those lives on a regular basis).

&gt;Should everyone receive and annual MRI to make sure they are healthy? Should a 101 year old woman receive a $100,000 heart transplant? Should a premie newborn receive $500,000 worth of life support?

Those are all medical questions! If we want to examine only the economic side of things, that's perfectly fine, but I don't think ignoring the ethical side of things would be useful for real life application. Currently, our system of health insurance is already set up to heavily bias treatment options towards the lowest cost, to the point that there have been multiple incidents across the nation for decades where insurance companies refuse to pay for treatment or delay approvals in the hopes that the person dies before they can be legally forced to pay. Most people agree that this is a bad way of doing things, and if your doctor tells you that you need a life saving medication or operation that it should be a medical decision, not a financial one. This is why the ridiculous notion of ""Obamacare death panels"" rattled so many people unnecessarily. The chance of consumers abusing the system to have ridiculously expensive medical procedures all the time is extremely low. The cost savings on dedicating panels of people to determine which treatments should be okay for which situations would be negligible at best, IMO. The consequences for health care, however, could be drastic, and those in the healthcare industry already know how to get around arcane limitations like that.

I work in the mental health field. Until very recently, getting mental health care paid for through an insurance plan or HMO was fairly difficult. The general thought on it was that some disorders were ""curable"" some were ""treatable"" and others were ""hopeless"". Most Axis-II diagnoses (Personality disorders, Autism Spectrum disorders, Mental Retardation, etc) were considered to be hopeless, and had limited coverage on most plans at best. Curable and treatable things were often covered, but they had to be strictly diagnosed based on the DSM. The problem is that mental disorders and human behaviors don't always group nicely into pre-made categories and check lists, like the DSM has. So people show up with 3 criteria from Major Depressive disorder, 2 from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and 1 or 2 from Borderline Personality Disorder (as an example). The person obviously needs help of some sort (therapy, medication, whatever is best for them), but they don't fit into a single category or diagnosis. What's a professional to do? Well, they jam the person into one of those categories, often using a ""Not Otherwise Specified"" tacked onto a disorder that will provide payment for treatment, and then prescribe off-label uses for drugs (anti-anxieties for treating depression) to make sure the person gets help.


I do sort of get what you're trying to say here, but at the same time, I think these are questions that will be constantly asked, answered, and adjusted as long as we need medical care, independent of what kind of system we use to obtain it. They're relevant questions now and they'd be relevant under any other system, just as they are in other countries around the world who have differing systems.",(pass),4591,220,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

261,"&gt;I see health care as a human right, thus falls under the umbrella of what government should provide.

This is why I find a libertarianism irritating as a philosophy, honestly. When presented with a situation like health care where markets obviously fail and lack of government involvement produces bad results (i.e. people dying of preventable diseases or reduced to penury through bad luck) they find themselves unable to endorse practical, tested solutions without first having a convoluted argument about ""rights.""

If there's a ""human right"" to healthcare, where do you draw the line? Should 95 year olds be entitled to free open-heart surgery? Should we pay for a potentially lifesaving treatment that has a 1% chance of working? What if that treatment costs a billion dollars. At what point do practical considerations have to step up and trample on someone's rights?

Maybe instead of framing every issue as whether the government has the ""right"" to do something or not, we should instead look at issues as problems and try to evaluate the effective solutions. Sometimes the best solutions will be market solutions, sometimes they'll involve a heavy-handed government (our solution to murder is and has been to give the government the ""right"" to imprison and, in some cases, kill citizens) but the solution should be determined by what actually works rather than some abstract political philosophy. 

This cuts both ways. Once you have this sort of ""limitations of government"" frame as the key criterion, it's not especially difficult to argue either side of an issue for or against government or human rights. Once you're arguing for universal health care somehow being acceptable in a libertarian framework, what *can't* fit? Pretty much any issue in American politics has multiple rights and interests on both sides, which is why those who favor severe government restrictions on abortion couch it as ""right to life."" Libertarians argue as if the rights at play are clear-cut, but in reality it's pretty easy to rationalize any position you want to have as one based on ""rights.""","Their position is *not* a libertarian position.  A libertarian would argue that there's too much government involvement and that government regulation has helped create the increase in prices.

Government regulations in health care are *extremely* complex.. so complex that it takes a myriad of administrative and legal staff just to ensure they're compliant.. so the associated administrative costs are astronomical.  Not to mention ridiculous costs associated with physicians' malpractice insurance and overcharging/price-gouging to ensure they receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid, and the uninsured.  And why can't individuals purchase insurance across state lines?  Regulation.  
*That's* the libertarian position and a position I think has credence.",4591,229,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

*That's* the libertarian position and a position I think has credence.","&gt;That's the libertarian position and a position I think has credence.

I guess it's a nice idea in theory, but the experience across the world is that more government involvement usually produces better results and always produces cheaper results. So the US's relatively free system is very expensive, and the UK's heavily controlled system (doctors and nurses are directly employed by the state) is extremely cheap. The two systems have roughly comparable health outcomes with some exceptions (and some that are hard to tease out from demographic factors).

The ""buy across state lines"" thing doesn't address adverse selection, which is the main issue limiting market solutions in health care. It's easy to see why the insurance industry pushes so hard for this, since it would allow them to pursue a ""race to the bottom"" and locate all insurance plans in the states with the loosest/friendliest regulations similar to the credit card industry. For what its worth, I think it's not a huge problem every credit card company operates out of Delaware or South Dakota, but there are actual regulations that matter in the insurance market (ones that prevent you from being dropped from your insurance when you get sick, for example) so a ""race to the bottom"" would be very problematic. Again, I get why the insurance industry promotes this ""buy across state lines"" bullshit in libertarian and conservative publications, but I think its embarrassing that activists in the libertarian movement actually buys it as a solution (since it has obvious problems and does nothing to address the real issue) rather than a giveaway to the industry.",4591,230,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

My argument was that a libertarian would not consider health care to be a ""human right"" just as fire protection and mail delivery are not a human rights.

There has never been a proper market for healthcare. The doctor only profits when we are sick or injured. A good market would pay the doctor when we are healthy and cost the doctor when we are sick or injured. 

We currently pay a subscription fee for medical care when we are healthy. The insurance companies pay doctors and hospitals a portion of that subscription fee when we are sick. US citizens pay private insurance companies 2.5 trillion dollars a year for access to doctors and hospitals. What all medical professionals earn each year is less than the 2.5 trillion dollars that we pay.  The insurance companies keep more of our money when we are healthy. The medical professionals only make money by charging the most they possibly can for visits and procedures. The incentives are all wrong and this is why medical costs are so high. We should pay doctors and hospitals a subscription fee when we are healthy in exchange for a commitment from doctors and hospitals to take care of every healthcare need. In other words, we should stop giving 2.5 trillion a year to insurance companies and give that money directly to the people that give us care. Doctors are hopefully smart people. They do not need a corporate gatekeeper with a Masters degree in business to dole out money to them. 
 
Here is how it would work. You pay your primary doctor each month who then contracts with a range of specialists and a hospital or two in your area. Your market choice becomes any primary care practice in your area. Your doctor is a part of a national reciprocation network that covers you when you travel and part of the money you pay your doctor goes into a national catastrophic fund for those rare illnesses that require travel and extended care. Prices would come down through competition. The hundreds of millions taken out in insurance company operations and profit could go to lower the price. Hospitals would be fully funded without having to admit a single patient so charging $80 for a box of tissues would end. Doctors would earn more money than investment bankers so the Doctors shortage would be over in a few years. The primary care doctor would be the center of the medical universe and he is already paid before you get sick so no unnecessary procedures or follow up visits. There would many alternatives like webcam diagnosis and phone call follow-ups that would be great for patients. How much illness is spread because Doctors cannot be paid unless sick people all gather and wait in the same room?
 
If we combine this change with strong malpractice tort reform then doctors will be able to reach out and be much more charitable. They will already be paid well so if we can limit the risk of giving care then doctors who are inclined to do so can give reduced rates or even free care for those who cannot afford their regular rates. In the US, the crux of the problem is charging by the visit or by the procedure. It is the wrong incentive. Doctors are paid more when the patient is sick. If you pay the doctor when you are healthy like you do the health insurance companies then the financial incentive to the doctor is to have you healthy and at home and not visiting or having a procedure.
 
A single person pays an average of $6,000 (including employer contributions) dollars a year for health care coverage. If that person is healthy he will see the doctor an average of three visits per year. Assume the average visit pays the doctor's practice $300. That is $900 dollars out of $6000 that goes to the doctor. Now suppose the entire $6,000 goes to the doctor. He uses half of that money to contract with a range of specialists practices and a hospital so that all of your local health needs are met. He also uses a bit of that half to add you to a reciprocation network so that you are fully covered when you travel. He also contributes a bit into a national catastrophic care fund that handles rare expensive cases that involve traveling to a specialist and experimental treatments etc. The doctor's practice now has $3000 guaranteed dollars from you instead of a speculative $900. That is more than three times what the doctor could eek out charging by visit. Everything but consumables is paid for. All salaries, the building, all the testing equipment is all paid in full before you arrive. The doctor is competing with the dozens of other practices in your community. The specialists and the hospitals are competing to be in the doctors networks. There is a lot of room for lower prices in this model. There is no compulsion to go back to the petrie dish waiting room for a follow up. much more cost effective for the doctor to call or skype. Internet medicine would no longer be stifled by insurance company or government rules. The internist or GP doctor would be the center of the medical universe as it should be.

Notice that this solution does not mention government. This plan would only require a consensus of courageous doctors to implement. The national average payout for medicare is more than $6000 a year. Government could pay the primary doctor on your behalf but the relationship and decisions would be between you and the doctor only.

So much money is wasted in HMO overhead and crazy pricing structures and haggling.  I read that doctors spend a considerable amount of time haggling with HMO's.  What makes the Canadian system great is not so much single payer model, but the efficiencies from it which cascade down, and other benefits from efficiencies else where.

I'll explain.  A doctor can graduate medical school with significantly less debt because of heavily subsidized education.  He can practice or work in a practice with minimal administrative staff, bill more working hours, and get immediate cash flow, all because of no HMO bureaucracy.  Similarly, other services like testing, diagnostics, etc. benefit from the same efficiencies.  As well, data can be mined from the central system to predict larger scale cost savings from vaccines, heart disease education, etc.  Access to the system is controlled via a Health Card.  Basically, like a drivers licence.  I go for an x-ray, I hand it to them, they swipe it, that is it, no paperwork.

&gt;As I mentioned in the original post, “If we’re lucky, a good single-payer system would slow the growth of health care costs over the long term, but it’s vanishingly unlikely to actually cut current costs.” And that’s pretty much what Lewin shows. The initial cost saving is small, but the cost containment measures inherent in a government-funded plan push the cost curve down over time. Their estimate is that within a decade Minnesota’s proposed plan would have been a third less expensive than business-as-usual. This is roughly what I’d expect for a national single-payer plan too.

&gt;Is it technically possible to cut initial spending more? Sure. We could nationalize the whole medical industry, cut nurse and doctor pay by a third across the board, and create a mandatory formulary for drugs at a tenth of the price we currently pay. When the revolution comes, maybe that will happen—and doctors and pharma executives will be grateful we didn’t just take them out and shoot them....

&gt; I don’t believe in Santa Claus, and I don’t believe that we can pass a bill that slashes health care costs to European levels. They’ve had decades of cost containment that got them to where they are.

397,"While true, that doesn't really get at the heart of my objection -- that the proximity of the US and Canada doesn't necessarily make them analogous for the purposes of healthcare (although you note quite correctly that the US's population density is not likely to be an insurmountable trouble, as Canada has done better with worse). 

Note that I'm not saying that single-payer would be bad. I think it would be an improvement over what we have now. But I'm also not convinced it would be the best option. Perhaps more importantly, I'm worried that building enthusiasm for single-payer based on unrealistic expectations of cost savings is harmful. I think it'll be harmful when the CBO comes out and says ""The Bernie Sanders crowd is wrong; this is going to cost a fuckton"" and that it'll be harmful five years after single-payer is passed, when fiscal conservatism is back in fashion and the Right can't stop talking about how we're paying 30% more than we expected to for healthcare.

EDIT: [This](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/) SSC article on cost disease is worthwhile for anyone interested in why America pays so much for healthcare. It's not directly on-point, but it's a good read.","Hmm That was an interesting read, Thank you.

&gt;The Canada Health Act, which sets the conditions with which provincial/territorial health insurance plans must comply if they wish to receive their full transfer payments from the federal government, does not allow charges to insured persons for insured services (defined as medically necessary care provided in hospitals or by physicians). Most provinces have responded through various prohibitions on such payments. This does not constitute a ban on privately funded care; indeed, about 30% of Canadian health expenditures come from private sources, both insurance and out-of-pocket payments.[86] The Canada Health Act does not address delivery. Private clinics are therefore permitted, albeit subject to provincial/territorial regulations, but they cannot charge above the agreed-upon fee schedule unless they are treating non-insured persons (which may include those eligible under automobile insurance or worker's compensation, in addition to those who are not Canadian residents), or providing non-insured services. This provision has been controversial among those seeking a greater role for private funding.

So in my example of Knee surgery, this could be offered outside the public system but the provider cannot charge more for it so why would they set up outside of the public system and build the infrastructure. Private care here is primarily things not covered by our government healthcare, like the Dentist.

If we have the money and want faster service we just go to the US (this is not very common, but an option)

This wouldn't really save money in the sense I'm most concerned about, which is bringing total healthcare costs down. It *would* probably result in a more progressive distribution of those costs, assuming the line-jumping fee was used to subsidize the care of the poor, and it's desirable in that sense. 

I want to highlight something, though: although line-jumping is a relatively minor example, it *is* an example of providing better care to those who pay more (it's more likely that your condition will worsen while you wait; also, the time that your condition is going untreated is time that your quality of life is lowered; both of these would have the effect that people paying more for healthcare get more QALY from healthcare). I think that we should probably do more things like this. We should provide a humane minimum standard of healthcare, but that minimum standard of healthcare would ideally include cost-cutting measures like, e.g., wellness checkups with nurses (or maybe P.A.s) instead of doctors and free hospital stays in cheap but clean [open or semi-open wards](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK274438/) (where safe) instead of private rooms.",(pass),6140,89,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

E.g. if you want to get an MRI faster or get another doctor to look over your results you can get it done privately. If you need cosmetic treatments you get them done privately. If the doctor sees you privately, it is literally going to be the same doctor treating you probably in the same hospital according to the exact same national guidelines, but they are likely to be nicer to you and give you a few extra minutes of their time since they are getting a little bonus out of it. The private options are only there to supplement your NHS treatment, not to replace it. ","It's basically the exact same approach in Canada.

Canadians are pretty resistant to opening up healthcare to too much privatization primarily because we have the American model right across the border constantly reminding us of what that could look like.

Canadians largely also don't want a two tiered system where the wealthy get amazing health care and public options repeatedly get slashed budgets to the point where it can barely be called healthcare. This is a similar strategy that we see happening in the US with education by the likes of Betsy Devos and kin.",6140,158,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
472,"I'm in the UK. Nominally we have private insurance but I think it's disingenuous to call it insurance policies as the term is understood around the world. Very few people use them, and they must exist within the context of the national health service. This is because practically all the hospitals, training, machines and resources except a very small handful for super rich clientele (mostly in London) are owned by the state. 

I work as a doctor in a hospital. Even if you have private insurance you will generally get treated in a government hospital by a government employee. The relationship between the private companies and the NHS is very complex to put into a comment box and it varies wildly by region and hospital. 

What's the point of it? Well it's up for huge debate. The doctor will treat you much better and work you up for longer since they are skimming a nice bonus off it and even totally unfounded patient complaints will make a big difference. You'll get a non urgent MRI in a week instead of 3 months... But the actual nitty gritty, it's really debatable whether you actually have any long term improvements in healthcare by having a private insurance policy or not. Probably the only real difference is that doctors and nurses will be nicer to you. 

The private options in the UK are just to supplement your healthcare really. Unless you're a super multi millionaire, you will still be getting most of your treatment in an NHS hospital.","Not quite.

&gt;Many, but not all, hospitals and clinics are owned by the government; some doctors are government employees, but there are also private doctors who collect their fees from the government. In Britain, you never get a doctor bill. These systems tend to have low costs per capita, because the government, as the sole payer, controls what doctors can do and what they can charge.

&gt;As it enters its fourth year, Maryland's all-payer model is exceeding expectations required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, according to a Health Affairs study.

&gt;The state achieved an estimated $429 million in total Medicare hospital savings to date, exceeding the model's five-year hospital savings requirement of $330 million, the study said.

&gt;From 2013 through August 2016, the hospital spending growth rate underlying the savings was more than 4 percent below the national growth rate.

&gt;It was also lower than the long-term growth rate of the state's economy, 2.31 percent in 2015 for hospitals, compared to Maryland's 3.58 percent per year.

They and the Urban Institute put out this report estimating the cost. They estimate that the additional federal expenditures on healthcare to fund single-payer would be $32 trillion.

As of 2015, [the US spent $3.2T on healthcare](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/highlights.pdf). That is TOTAL expenditures, not just government expenditures. At that amount, we already had the highest per-capita healthcare cost [by a substantial margin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita)

Given that, I find the claim that we would add an ADDITIONAL $3.2T to the budget ludicrous (to $5.1T with the existing $1.9T the government currently spends). That would increase our per capita costs from $9990/person to $15890/person. 

[Edit: The study predicts an increase of $2.5T in 2017, so it would be $4.4T or $13707 person]

I didn't read the study you cited in detail, but a quick read of it suggest that they are assuming costs billed for a given procedure will remain stable, but that we will be increasing coverage and adding millions more people to the healthcare rolls. That is a naive interpretation. There are MANY ways that single payer can save money-- simply getting rid of the ban on medicaid negotiating drug prices would greatly lower the costs.

It is certainly possible, even probable, that single payer would result in a short-term spike in costs as we begin treating people who were previously uninsured, but I don't see any rational argument that the long term costs will continue at that rate.

It's not ludicrous at all. Many of the uninsured sick would be placed on single-payer, have to be paid for, and the healthy young who would be placed on would pay less into the system since they make less money. Plus, when you add coverage to people, and they're no longer relying on coverage from silver plans alone, costs go up. And people use healthcare more when they have insurance.

That is a naive interpretation. There are MANY ways that single payer can save money-- simply getting rid of the ban on medicaid negotiating drug prices would greatly lower the costs.

No, it wouldn't greatly lower costs at all. The CBO said back in [2004 that](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/108th-congress-2003-2004/reports/fristletter.pdf) this would have a ""negligible effect"" on spending, and that's for Medicare, which is even larger than Medicaid as a program. If Medicare Part D got the same prices as Medicaid and the VA, it would save [only $15 billion or so per year](https://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2015/07/23/u-s-could-save-up-to-16b-if-medicare-part-d-negotiated-prices-paper/).

That's virtually nothing, with the costs we're talking about. By the way, Medicaid doesn't negotiate drug prices, it [literally has price controls already](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/us/16drug.html).

Something tells me you should read the whole study.

&gt;It is certainly possible, even probable, that single payer would result in a short-term spike in costs as we begin treating people who were previously uninsured, but I don't see any rational argument that the long term costs will continue at that rate. There are simply too many opportunities for cost savings.

Because insuring the 10% of the population that remains uninsured will lead to cost increases. So will the increase in usage of medical services that are available when you have single-payer, and so will spending on long-term services and supports, if that is included as Sanders proposed.","Reading the study further, they say the cost increase in 2017 would be $2.5T. That means the total would be about $4.4T if I have all the numbers right. That is an increase of about 37.5% over the total expenditures (OOP, Premiums and government expenditures) in 2015. Given that we already know costs have increased since 2015, I don't think estimating a 30% increase is unreasonable.

So yes, I would agree that is not completely ludicrous, though it still seems a bit high to me. 

However, in exchange for that increase, we get a healthier populace. A healthier populace means higher productivity, and reduced lost-work costs to employers. Medical bankruptcies would be eliminated, and hospitals writing off bad debt would be eliminated. 

Given these external factors, it's hard to estimate the actual effect on the %GDP cost, but it's clear that the actual effect on the economy would be a lot less than a simple reading of ""It will cost $32T!!!"" suggests. 


&gt; It's not ludicrous at all. Many of the uninsured sick would be placed on single-payer, have to be paid for, and the healthy young who would be placed on would pay less into the system since they make less money.

Only about 13.4% of Americans are currently uninsured, so I can't see it increasing that much.

&gt; and the healthy young who would be placed on would pay less into the system since they make less money. Plus, when you add coverage to people, and they're no longer relying on coverage from silver plans alone, costs go up. And people use healthcare more when they have insurance.


These all would result in a SHIFT in the expenses, from for-profit insurance companies and out-of-pocket expenses. They would not result in HIGHER expenses. That said, it is possible that single payer would result in higher utilization, even compared to insured people, so some increase is probably reasonable.

The current title is a bit leading. In order to frame it in a neutral way, it would be preferable to ask something like, ""What are the advantages and disadvantages of the long nomination and election process in the USA?"" That would cover components 2, 3 and 6.

For the rest, you just need to provide a little background with a source. I suggest you do a quick web search for ""shorten the election cycle"" and see if you can find an article or two that talks about the reasoning behind such proposals. Link to the article(s) in your post and give a sentence or two of background and you're done.

Wyoming has the smallest population in the US, 576,412 people. So each resident of Wyoming is paying less than 14 cents a year to furnish their senator's office. Most US citizens pay less than a cent per year for this.

","Sure, I can link you to some of the books used in university-level courses on corruption, an aspect of the abuse of power. Nearly all studies of this subject in the political science academia show a correlation that higher salary is correlated with less corruption. 

But inferring that this means increasing salary would automatically kill corruption is entirely not understanding how political science and economics work. Abuse of power occurs in situations that have countless factors allowing them to thrive: lack of oversight, lack of accountability, disenfranchised citizens, lack of competition, societal standards, moral values, lack of coverage, government infrastructure, and government negligence just to name a few. For unique situations, maybe one factor could be the tipping point, but for most abuse of power cases it is a combination of such factors or lack thereof. Limiting the presences of these factors would lead to a decline of likelihood of abuse of power. High salary itself is not enough to rid government of corruption.

There is a difference between paying private company executives higher salary than paying public officials because public officials have more public scrutiny and accountability expectation than business leaders, at least in democratic states. Also, public officials and business leaders have different responsibilities and interests.

In the US, the Constitution is the prevailing document of law. Its stated purpose is ""to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity"". That says nothing about managing the economy, and traditionally, the US practiced something closer to [Laissez-faire capitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire#United_States) than we have now.

The shift occurred because political analysts realized that the people would often vote in their economic best interests, so it was easier to get elected if you could demonstrate policies that would broadly strenthen the economy. Ronald Reagan famously ran by asking voters, ""Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"" James Carville opined as Bill Clinton's campaign strategy, ""It's the economy, stupid!""

As for pros and cons, I think the pros are obvious. But if we incentivize economic performance, what happens when the economic benefit of a policy stands in conflict with officials' other duties? For instance, abolition of slavery was disastrous to the South, and the resulting Civil War nearly bankrupted the entire nation. Does that mean elected officials would have been right to support slavery? Generally speaking, war brings about strong economic performance. Does that mean we should incentivize elected officials to keep us in a state of constant war? There are so many policies that are right, just, and of widespread benefit to the populace that don't result in direct improvement to the economy (especially within the average elected official's term).

Edit: 10 to 9, not 8 to 7, including the ex officio members. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence","None of the responses addressed your core question so let me take a stab at it:

First, the investigation/s of Russia and their possible state-sponsored interference of the US election. It's worth noting for the past 50ish years most countries keep a respectful distance from one another during their democratic processes. They tend to shy away from picking one candidate over another and make generic statements such as ""looking forward to our continued partnership"".  In the case of Russia  there is a growing concern that Russia is actively engaged in attempting to tilt/shift elections in multiple countries in ways that are advantageous to their interests, either by electing people who are pro Russia or people who will execute policies that are beneficial to Russia. In the case of the US there appears to be evidence and consensus among the US intelligence community that the Russians obtained information about politicians in the US and selectively released it to their advantage. On one end of the scale you have the Russians who say they were not involved, that the US only has its self to blame for its problems. On the other you have a chorus of people claiming the Russians ""stole"" the election and thwarted the entire democratic process. In the middle you have people who claim the Russians had a goal of weakening/discrediting a future president Clinton and just got really lucky with their efforts.

Second, Trump. That's a loaded one so I'm going to tried carefully. Trumps investigations, if any, break down into 3 main groups:

1. Possible collusion between his campaign and the Russians during the election. There is ample speculative evidence due to many of his key staffers having direct or indirect ties to Russia but beyond that nothing public has come for light that has triggered a criminal investigation (that we know of). Plenty of investigations and conducted in secret and/or concluded with nothing substantive found. 

2. Trumps personal business dealings. Trump and his many companies have relationships around the globe. There are concerns about them beyond Russia, but given the alleged Russian involvement I mentioned earlier many have made accusations that trump, his family, or his business ventures could directly benefit from his presidency. The accusers cite Trumps unwillingness to release his tax returns and other information as proof of some form of guilt, whereas his supporters note he has complied to disclose where required by law.

3. Blackmail. There have been wild and salacious accusations directed at Trump and others in his staff, that the Russians have obtained deeply embarrassing or illegal material and are being blackmailed.

While some of the things I mentioned aren't explicitly illegal there's been a pervasive sense of ""truth in lending"" with our public officials. This is the first time in modern history that a President has asserted his right to still be a private citizen, which people who oppose him immediately tend to assume implies deceit.

Third, Michael Flynn. I won't touch on the financial accusations with Russia only to say there are some floating around. The big one is his potential violation of the Logan Act. Basically, it's illegal to conduct the business of the United States with foreign governments if you aren't elected to an official capacity in the government that requires you to perform those functions. In the case of Mr Flynn he may have gotten ahead of himself in his conversations with his Russian counterparts before he actually started working in his official capacity at the National Security Counsel. It's important to note that no one has ever been prosecuted for the Logan Act. That being said Mr Flynn did resign from his position, so he either did so to avoid distracting the new administration with a ""scandal"" or he wanted to avoid a formal investigation. Either way, it seems to have settled down for now.

The bottom line is you have a new administration who was not elected via popular vote. The opposition to the Trump administration is going to magnify any grain of information that comes out, and the press will run with it because it brings good ratings. Whether these things will actually bring some form of an investigation remains to be seen.

698,"None of the responses addressed your core question so let me take a stab at it:

First, the investigation/s of Russia and their possible state-sponsored interference of the US election. It's worth noting for the past 50ish years most countries keep a respectful distance from one another during their democratic processes. They tend to shy away from picking one candidate over another and make generic statements such as ""looking forward to our continued partnership"".  In the case of Russia  there is a growing concern that Russia is actively engaged in attempting to tilt/shift elections in multiple countries in ways that are advantageous to their interests, either by electing people who are pro Russia or people who will execute policies that are beneficial to Russia. In the case of the US there appears to be evidence and consensus among the US intelligence community that the Russians obtained information about politicians in the US and selectively released it to their advantage. On one end of the scale you have the Russians who say they were not involved, that the US only has its self to blame for its problems. On the other you have a chorus of people claiming the Russians ""stole"" the election and thwarted the entire democratic process. In the middle you have people who claim the Russians had a goal of weakening/discrediting a future president Clinton and just got really lucky with their efforts.

Second, Trump. That's a loaded one so I'm going to tried carefully. Trumps investigations, if any, break down into 3 main groups:

1. Possible collusion between his campaign and the Russians during the election. There is ample speculative evidence due to many of his key staffers having direct or indirect ties to Russia but beyond that nothing public has come for light that has triggered a criminal investigation (that we know of). Plenty of investigations and conducted in secret and/or concluded with nothing substantive found. 

2. Trumps personal business dealings. Trump and his many companies have relationships around the globe. There are concerns about them beyond Russia, but given the alleged Russian involvement I mentioned earlier many have made accusations that trump, his family, or his business ventures could directly benefit from his presidency.

I'd argue that the real root of domestic radicalization is simply young Muslims going to these mosques and madrassahs and becoming radicalized.

After all, the perpetrators of the San Bernandino attacks were not destitute [as far as I can tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack#Rizwan_Farook)","&gt; How important is the threat of ""home-grown"" Islamic terrorism compared to foreign threats?

The threat of foreign fighters is [greatly exaggerated](http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2015/01/western-foreign-fighters-in-syria-and-iraq-byman-shapiro). Home-growth terrorists are a far greater threat than foreign terrorists for few reasons. First, these individuals have a far better understanding of the local terrain (human and physical) than a foreigner and can easily blend in with the population. They understand the language and culture, they know nuances of the locations they are operating in, and they have social ties and networks (family, friends, colleagues) that they can rely upon. Second, a foreigner has to go through security that a local does not, such as at border crossings and checkpoints. Additionally, a citizen of the country is less likely to come under scrutiny when leaving and returning than a foreign is when they enter for the first time. From a purely logistical perspective, it is easier to radicalize a resident from the country a foreign terrorist organization wishes to target than it is to send a resident from another country or send back a foreign fighter from that country. 

&gt; What is the true cause of domestic radicalisation?

This is a very difficult question to answer. Scholars have been trying to answer the question of ""why someone becomes a terrorist"" for decades now. Despite millions of dollars in government funding and untold man hours spent researching the topic, [there still is no good answer](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/world/europe/mystery-about-who-will-become-a-terrorist-defies-clear-answers.html). Since the [1970s](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/notes/2007/N1300.pdf), social scientists have been trying to develop a rubric for what makes a person a terrorist, with no success. Although they are generally able to mind commonalities between those who engage in terrorism, the characteristics that these individuals share are not unique to them. The individual motivations and personality factors are too diverse to develop a usable model. 

That said, there are a number of generalizable characteristics that terrorists share that are important to keep in mind when trying to understand why people become radicalized. Applying these characteristics to specific individuals will not always be accurate; think of them more as trend lines rather than specific data points. 

**1)** Terrorism is also motivated by a strong sense of altruism, albeit one that is misguided. For people engaging in terrorism, it is a means to greater end. They see themselves engaging in violence on behalf of some constituency--such as a religion, ethnic group, political ideology, etc--with a sense of self-righteousness and self-sacrifice (i.e. ""I fight so that my ____ can do/be ____""). Additionally, many terrorists state that they did not want to use violence, but were given no other alternative (this is their perception, not reality). They see themselves as reluctant warriors. Although it is rare for individuals, the group will state that their use of violence is just and legitimate. They will point to the alleged ""crimes"" of their enemy and state that they are matching their enemy's violence in kind. However, these individuals lack the power to change the system through non-violent means, either because their views are unpopular or the political system doesn't allow it. Therefore they engage in terrorism, as it is the only means at their disposal, which is why terrorism is called a tool of the weak). The terrorists will use violence to bring attention to their cause, with the goal of gathering recruits and support and placing pressure against the target of their attacks. This is a phenomenon called ""propaganda by deed,"" and has been an element in every terrorist's strategy since the advent of modern terrorism.

**2)** Social networks are a hugely important element when it comes to joining a terrorist organization. Individuals are more likely to join an organization their relatives or friends are already members, as those members can both advocate for the terrorist group and its ideology. For example, six active members of one of the best [soccer clubs in Hebron became suicide bombers](http://www.newsweek.com/jihad-soccer-club-139565). Terrorists will also frequently join in groups, where they encourage each other to join an organization that none of the them would have likely joined on their own. In this case, the individuals continue to push each other further in their beliefs and actions until they become willing to engage in terrorism. The [D.C. Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.C._Five) is one example of this, and it appears that the two bombers in the Brussels attack were as well. Once a part of a terrorist organization, the values of the group and the decision to use terrorism is continually reinforced by group-think and group dynamics. This is further exacerbated by the covert nature of terrorist groups, as critical dissent is discouraged by other members. Similar psychological processes occurs here on Reddit (though without the violence) when users in subreddits consistently upvote material they agree upon, while downvoting anything that deviants from the accepted narrative (i.e. a circle jerk).  

**3)** There is often a catalyst event for each terrorist that is pivotal to their radicalization. Usually this kind of event is an attack on their constituency by a real or perceived enemy. This event can be personal--such as abuse someone suffered from an authority--or it can be a public and widely seen event--like a military intervention into a foreign country. But this catalyst can also be a personal and intimate crisis. It can be economic (losing a job, feeling blocked from economic mobility), personal (death in the family, family conflict, feelings of victimization), or social/cultural (racism, feelings of marginalization or social humiliation). These crises create what psychologists call a ""[cognitive opening](http://insct.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Wiktorowicz.Joining-the-Cause.pdf)"", whereby an individual becomes receptive to the possibility of new ideas and worldviews. It is during this time when the individual will be more receptive to material that can lead them down the path of radicalization. Of course, this is hardly a perfect indicator of whether someone would be a terrorists; the same events that may drive one to terrorism can spur someone to do charity or serve their country. 

&gt; What are the most effective methods of preventing such radicalisation?

Unfortunately, it is really difficult to say. However, as you can likely see from the paragraphs above, radicalization is related far more to social and psychological elements that religious ones, many of which can be hidden to authorities, community leaders, or even close family and friends. As John Horgan states, ""an attempt to help an individual reinterpret hadiths is far less important than understanding the meaning of their involvement, the factors that mobilized them into action in the first place, and what led to their disengagement."" Any radicalization program or deradicalization program needs to take these elements into consideration. 

We have already seen success from some deradicalization programs such as the one in [Saudi Arabia](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/persian-gulf/2010-05-01/getting-deradicalization-right). The Saudi program adopts a holistic approach that deals not only with countering radical ideology, but also deals with the psychological and social issues that facilitated the radicalization. Families play a very important role in deradicalization and the individuals in question are often given [vocational training and therapy](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/saudi-de-radicalization-center-uses-art-therapy-tackle-extremists-n299246). The result is a program that gives its participants optimism for their future. Although the program has been fairly successful (less than 20% of participants return to terrorism), it still has a lot of room for improvement. 

But Some people cannot be de-radicalized. They may believe so so thoroughly in their cause that their minds cannot be swayed. According to Jerrold M. Post, ""the terrorist whose only sense of significance come from being terrorists cannot be forced to give up terrorism, for to do so would be to lose their very reason for being."" For these individuals, removing them from society (one way or another) may be the only option.",263,11,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

I get what you mean, and I think it's very important to realise that terrorists are misguided 'trying to do the right thing' in their own messed up world-view, rather than the untrue cop-out of just framing them as 'evil', or psychopaths bent on destruction.

But I think 'idealistic' is more accurate than 'altruistic'; yes, they think they are making the tough decisions for the greater good, but the willingness to sacrifice others, imo, betrays the fact that, even in the terrorist's mind, these are not really 'altruistic' acts, generally. (maybe an exception is those few 'terrorists like the unabomber or the Weather Underground who actively seek to minimise deaths, and just damage property. Maybe.)

IMO terrporism is much more about being *anti* status quo than *pro* whatever ideology the terrorist follows. I suspect that a certain % of people (usually young males) in the West are a certain kind of angry/disaffected/generally messed up, and will vent that through whatever avenue is available; if they identify as a part of the status quo/mainstream culture, they will become a school shooter. If they are in an ethnic group group that feels outside of the mainstream (ie. Muslim heritage) they are likely to become a 'homegrown terrorist', instead. 

Basically the same acts, but viewed very differently by society; even someone like Dylan Roof, who clearly saw his acts as socio/political is generally framed as a 'school/spree shooter' rather than a 'terrorist'.

For example, in Arkansas, the state constitution was amended in the 1980s to fund schools in vaguely worded way, the gist of which was that the Legislature had to pay education accounts first before paying off other line items.  

Everyone kind of forgot about it until a few years later when a poor and underfunded school district called Lake View challenged their lack of funding on constitutional grounds, citing that amendment.  Lake View itself was represented on a contingency basis by some rather low-rent lawyers, but other school districts in the state saw the value of their argument and took the ball and ran with it.  By the early 2000s, Mike Huckabee (then governor, just as die-hard a Republican as Brownback) was forced by the Arkansas Supreme Court to appoint a Blue Ribbon Commission to oversee school funding, and the Legislature was court-ordered to fund the schools as recommended by that Commission.  As a result Arkansas's composite ranking across categories like teacher pay and test performance jumped from basically 49th in every category (""Thank God for Mississippi"") to close to the national average.  It was expensive but the results were popular, and, after all, it reflected the will of the voters.

The point I think is this: voters are always all for taxes being cut and other people's benefits being reduced, but no one really wants to take it in the teeth themselves.  Even in a super-red state like Arkansas or Kansas, they will also vote for broad-brush ideas like ""education gets funded first"" without real regard for conservative principles or really any economic theory at all.

736,"The interesting thing about the single-payer argument is that in a lot of ways we already have universal insurance, and we've had it for years.

Reagan signed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act in 1986.  That law made it illegal for any hospital which takes Medicare funds to turn away any individual who needs emergency treatment regardless of ability to pay or national origin.

I practice law in the Atlanta area.  We see ""self-pay"" (which means ""no pay"") plaintiffs every single day.  Someone without insurance gets in a car wreck, goes to the hospital, gets treated.  The hospital sends a bill.  They do not pay the bill.  The bill goes to collections.  They cannot pay the bill collector either.  Eventually the bill gets written off as bad debt by the hospital, which gets a tax deduction but otherwise gets screwed.  Except this is so normal, the hospital simply makes up its billing deficits by over-charging other customers and their insurers for routine procedures.  This is how a simple MRI gets to be $4,000 instead of the $800 it costs at a standalone facility.  Insurers, in turn, push back by refusing to pay above a certain percentage (Medicare/Medicaid does the same thing).  A classic arms race ensues, with insurers negotiating lower and lower percentage payments, charged-amounts ever increasing, and those with the ability to pay ultimately funding those who cannot.

In other words, we *have had universal health care for years.*  Push this structure out to the extreme and you get what are localled called ""the Gradies"" - indigents who cannot afford care but who know that if they walk into the emergency room at Grady Hospital in downtown Atlanta, they will be seen and given some form of basic treatment.  The Gradies treat the Grady E/R as their primary care clinic.  Because Grady is in a rough part of town and treats an extremely high proportion of indigents, there aren't enough people paying full freight to float their debts.  Thus Grady goes into crisis mode once a decade or so and has to be bailed out.

See, e.g., http://www.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/state-could-offer-bailouts-safety-net-hospitals/RYUAFX3WgjsaEtKPh6daAN/

http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2003/06/23/daily29.html

What this all means is, we have an unregulated and *inefficient* market for public healthcare right now.  All the normal market forces are already at work, with those who can pay footing the bill for basic care for those who cannot pay (the same end result of universal single-payer healthcare), but there is a Byzantine web of middlemen, insurance billing specialists, coders who input billing codes just the right way, lawyers, public and private investors all mixed up in the system.  I have a friend who makes a rich six figure salary just consulting with hospitals on how to increase their recovery percentages (kind of like search engine optimization just for hospital billing).

There are lots of objections to universal health care as it has been proposed, but the one thing I never heard in the entire Obamacare debate was a basic statement of how the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 impacts the existence of a world full of ""Gradies.""  A single payer system may not be ideal but it would at least push all this out into the light.

Tl;dr: We already have universal health care because Reagan said the hospitals can't turn people away to die in the streets.

741,"So I am a Healthcare IT consultant. I use big data to analyze what actually helps. Currently there is a program called Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) that allow healthcare organizations to share risk with patients. When they sign up, they get access to ALL of the claims data on the patients that they are at risk for. 

So we have organizations that give us 3 years of data of all the payments out on patients. Great! big data. 

One of the key analysis that i have done recently is something called annual wellness visits. (AWVs) that involve setting care programs and talk about wellness with medicare patients (65+). We also have risk scores for each patient based on their information. (statistical r-squared value of .79... aggregated with more than 30,000 patients makes it even better) 

When comparing patients with Annual Wellness Visits (which is preventative medicine at its finest) those patients statistically cost 1,500$ less than per year in costs AFTER RISK ADJUSTMENT! times that by the 40 million people on medicare. that's a ton of money. 52 BILLION DOLLARS!

BUT if one does not have insurance... they are unable to pay for these preventative things that statistically save society money.

Strong disagree.  Ignoring the fact that [more than half a million people are bankrupted every year by medical bills](http://www.snopes.com/643000-bankruptcies-in-the-u-s-every-year-due-to-medical-bills/) (something that is virtually unheard-of in countries with *actual* single-payer), and setting aside the order-of-magnitude cost increases caused by the inefficiencies and redundancies that you mentioned, equating our must-treat rules with a proper universal system is ludicrous.  

The rules only require the hospital to stabilize and treat immediate problems.  If you break your leg, they have to set the bone but they don't have to provide physical therapy.  If you have a heart attack, they have to try to keep you from dying but they'll kick you out as soon as you're stable (along with a prescription for statins and blood thinners that they know damn well you can't afford).  If you show up in labor they'll deliver the baby, but if you show up a month early for prenatal care they'll tell you to pound sand.  This level of treatment is objectively unequal to the level of treatment that a wealthy/insured patient would receive.  It is far below the level of treatment that people in some developing countries receive. Hell, you know our system is broken when you're better off being poor and sick in Andorra or Colombia than in the US.

The only thing ""universal"" about the emergency-room-mandate is that it's universally bad.

My rebuttal is, *you are already paying for a lot of this*.  Worse, there's a ton of graft and inefficiency and unequal distribution of burdens as a result of the under-the-table system we have now.  Regulating it, acknowledging that it exists, improving it with pre-natal and preventative care; all of that makes better financial sense than people realize.  In fact I have a sneaking suspicion universal health care would arrest the runaway medical costs we see in this country by eliminating a massive and ever growing number of unseen middlemen sucking on the system.

Most people have not been as close to stacks of medical bills as I have, and they haven't had the chance to see how much the bills for a given procedure vary.  I cited MRIs but there are surgeries--neck fusions for example--that might cost $40,000 at one hospital and $80,000 at another. That's in large part due to the latter hospital having a higher indigent care burden.  The point of insurance is to spread out the costs, and bigger pools get better premium rates.

For all that spending, though, we aren't receiving a noticeably better level of treatment than those countries: we actually rank [12th out of the 12 wealthiest industrialized nations](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/04/20/524774195/what-country-spends-the-most-and-least-on-health-care-per-person) in terms of health outcomes. It's worth noting, too, that not only do we spend more per capita than any other country, but that we spend more *public* money per capita than all but two of the countries *with a publicly funded universal care system* ([source here](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective)):

&gt;Even though the U.S. is the only country without a publicly financed universal health system, it still spends more public dollars on health care than all but two of the other countries.

So we're spending more money, both privately and publicly, for far fewer people covered and no noticeable medical benefits. I would think that anyone looking at these numbers would agree that the US could benefit greatly from a single-payer system, but for so many of us, it seems those are three dirty words.  ","You know, they say the US spends 2x more per capita on health care, but what does that actually mean? Are salaries to those in the biotech sector counted as in that amount?

&gt;more than in any other country except Norway ($4,981) and the Netherlands ($4,495), despite the fact that the U.S. was the only country studied that did not have a universal health care system

The problem with emergent care is that you have to diagnose in order to determine whether the condition is an emergency or not.  And there is always a .01% chance of a misdiagnosis.  That creates the potential for exposure for *malpractice*, meaning the hospitals have to do more than the absolute bare minimum because they get sued if they decide a guy needs a cast and in fact he has a blood clot which results in his death.

As a result most of these indigent patients end up receiving what amounts to bare-bones clinic type care in the E/R, in order to shield the hospital from potential lawsuits.

One guy, 30's, stoner, (he said he was harvesting the next day and invited is for a party) asked if this was my friend's first time there, then explained how it's a great place for removing MRSA like some four-star Yelp review.  Then for some unknown reason he pulled his pants down and showed us the MRSA sore on his right buttcheek that we totally could have done without seeing. 

Another guy told me that a man brought his son for treatment and then completely made up the boy's details because they had no insurance or ability to pay at all.","I understand your argument but I dont see the math, treating indigents in hospital does not mean universal care nor a substantially higher cost of treatment for the system if compared to other more relevant costs like overpriced pharmaceuticals, bureacrats whose sole purpose is to haggle and paper file among insurers, attorneys, medical facilities and clients, and overpaid doctors:

1. Other countries that treat indigents dont have the same high costs (page 13 http://healthcare.mckinsey.com/sites/default/files/MGI_Accounting_for_cost_of_US_health_care_full_report.pdf).

2. The battalion of paper pushers you see in any medical office in america (people that are not in any way related to medicine but are receptionists, people that are there to negotiate with the insurers, generate and charge bills...etc) has to be a higher cost than the indigents ""leeching out on emergency rooms"".

3. Doctors salaries in america seem higher than they should be (https://medicfootprints.org/10-highest-paid-countries-world-doctors/ and https://journal.practicelink.com/vital-stats/physician-compensation-worldwide/)


4. The price of pharmaceuticals in the US are high (overpriced and old drugs) - https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-drug-prices/. Intuitively, only in america, a pharma rep makes 6 figures - that has a cost.

A simple one is keeping most of your money in a closely-held corporation and never actually taking it as income. If you need money quickly, you can get a loan from the corp, otherwise, you can pay capital gains taxes (roughly 15%) instead of income taxes (roughly 35% plus various others) on your investments.

Keep ""investing"" any profits so your corp never pays taxes itself (since the corp made zero dollars in taxable profits).

There is also the enormous number of benefits that likely shouldn't be writeoffs but are. Use of a corporate jet? You can write that off if you can come up with a bullshit business reason for the trip. Thousand square foot corner office in Manhattan? Same deal. $5000 dinner with ""business contacts""? Writeoff.

","Not a loophole per se but capital gains tax is probably the biggest one. 

Carried interest, lots of tax cuts only avail available to business owners, shifting tax liabilities to future dates, trust stuff, off shore stuff, profit shifting between entities.

But the simple fact is that, in terms of basic human needs, we've been post-scarcity for decades, and capitalism is still going strong.

Instead of recognizing that we've created so much housing we can't unload it all, we complain that not everyone can afford a McMansion.

That's because other for other jobs humans are still better and thus their wages didn't drop so far. The moment all work is easily replaced by machines. Everything equals out and you could actually do manual labor again as a human. The 1:1 ratio between pens and apples comes to mind because it applies here.

Ok, we are talking about two different things then. sure, *technically* sunlight has scarcity. A finite amount hits the earth daily, and eventually it will run out. *Pragmatically* that point is meaningless. That can be extrapolated to the majority of needs and wants.

Anything the lack of which will lead to your demise.

Because that's how Marx described it.  This discussion is about Marx's conception of capitalism and communism.

&gt;Capitalism isn't required for development.

According to Marx it is.

&gt;Capitalism is good as long as scarcity of basic resources prevents people from making progress.

With Bush2, we have an opportunity to look at the introduction of new tax cuts under a new administration in a continuing and stable GDP, real GDP, unemployment, household income, and federal deficit, and see how they operate over the course of years.

Until that is done, there is little reason to believe it will magically work in practice considering that doesn't appear to be  the case in real world experiments. ","&gt; GDP growth was lower under Bush2 than Clinton, 2.1% to 3.9%, respectively. Real GDP growth was also lower, 3.8% to 4.7%. Total jobs created were 2.1 million under Bush2 (though that's subtracting the 3.6 million lost in 2008), while under Clinton some 21.5 million jobs were created.

It gets really complicated to make such a claim because you're essentially ignoring state policies. This was also the era of governors like Weld and Johnson who were pushing fiscally conservative state policies alongside Clinton's policy. Overall, what was the makeup of state-level policies that was matched up to each presidential term? I don't know the answer to that question, but it really complicates the ability to attribute what happened under a federal administration as the result of the federal policy made.

That's in addition to asking how much we can separate it from private industry matters. Bill Clinton's presidency also essentially coincides with the rise of both the personal computer and the internet. If you follow the history of these things, it's clear that these pivotal moments were going to happen anyways and the companies that profited from it started their work in the time of Reagan and Bush1, but obviously they created an insane amount of wealth and many of today's richest people in the world. It was a very special time. It was a bubble. And that bubble burst near 2000 in a way that doesn't really make sense to attribute to the government. As a result of the bubble bursting (and the stabilization of the PC paradigm), it really was a big slow down in the industry until the next paradigm shift, when the Apple iPhone was released in June of '07 which created an entirely different and massive industry, the smartphone. I'm not saying that these completely explain the differences in economic performance that happens to sort of line up with presidential terms, but these massive economic events are an example of how tough it is to attribute GDP growth to simply the tax policy at the top. The sample size is WAY too small to claim much certainty.

At the same time, to what extent do we trace the actual money? The argument by Republicans is that when taxes are low on the wealthy, their money goes into investments. Investments aren't something that produces immediate responses. They are something that allows startups like Facebook, YouTube, Android (the company it came from), etc. to survive long enough to turn into large successful ventures. These are all giants today that were born in the climate of Bush2. I'm not saying that Bush2's policies made these companies, but that it's important to note that what was exploding under Obama and Clinton, was often born under Bush2 and Bush1. These things take years (perhaps, into another presidents term) to pay off. Taxes themselves are slow to go from the presidents desk to the actual IRS policy and, from there, even slower to start to drive any real economic change either way.

I'd say subsidies are more effective from a supply side than a demand side. Or am I just under that impression because we keep trying to solve supply side issues with demand subsidies (health care insurance, student loans, etc.) and failing miserably because of that?

Supply side subsidies is also used in many areas of public goods. Any funding of businesses/public services to help reach more consumers/users at a fairer price or being fully covered is supply side. And our government participates in that all the time.

1028,"In general a ""supply side"" issue is anything that prevents enough of something, either product or service, from being present in the marketplace.

Supply Side policies attempt to address the shortfall through making capital more available to business. Whether that's through lowering the federal interest rate (cheaper borrowing), tax deduction (lowering operating costs or making expansion less expensive), government subsidies (direct or indirect), or other means.

Right now I'm struggling to think of any non-government market segments that have insufficient capacity to meet demand. I submit that nearly all commercial segments have _excess_ capacity relative to demand.

Based on your last sentence I believe you and I are basically in agreement however I'd say that what you're really talking about are _failed_ supply side economics (I'm referring to them as policies).

IMHO the reason Supply Side policies are failing is because the problem isn't with the supply of anything, it's with the _demand_.

Expressed very simply I believe that the root of the demand problem is that too large of a percentage of our population simply don't have enough disposable income.

Increasing supply does you no good if there's a lack of demand due to insufficient income. As a business owner the government (Federal, State, Local) can give me all the subsidies they want but if there's no one there to buy my product or service then I'm not going to invest my time, organizational energy, or money in it.

Edit: I did actually think of one commercial market segment with insufficient supply.

There is certainly a balance that ought to be struck and that balance may be different in place and time.

The federal government has the power to create and circulate new currency through deficit spending. When the government deficit spends, it creates a private sector surplus. That's money flowing from the government to people and business. When the government has a budget surplus, it creates a private sector deficit, reducing (ceteris paribus) the money held by private persons and business.

Wealth isn't finite. Smith, Ricardo, Bastiat, and even Marx agree. There is no need to ""recycle wealth"". Instead, we should seek to prevent [rent-seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking) behavior.

The money and wealth you aim to tax, has already been taxed according to laws and it belongs to its owner's estate.

Estate taxes don't raise nearly as much money as you think they do, and they actually are pretty easily avoided. Just ask the Kennedys.

In practice, inheritance taxes (like almost all other taxes) disproportionately affect the upper-middle class, or the lower-rich. They never actually hit the absurdly wealthy you are aiming for. By taking from those most equipped to ascend to the highest ranks of society, you effectively remove social mobility instead of enhancing it.",7132,11,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

1067,"I'm under the impression estates are taxed at 35% in excess of 1mm. That's already fairly high.

With a higher tax, tax avoidance would go way up. Parents would hire their children and pay them, engage in favor trading, understate values, et cetera. Life insurance would become extremely popular - or do you also want to tax life insurance proceeds above 1mm?

People near death would be more tempted to liquidate their investments late in life and spend it all on _whatever_. 

People would work less hard and likely retire earlier.

Most large estates are going to be businesses. If the estate tax was ""very high"" then the new owner of a business would have to do some sort of forced sale to pay the taxes which is likely inefficient.

People would engage in more wasteful investments in their children. I'd expect that the cost of education would increase. If it is inefficient to leave money to children, then sending your children to a wastefully expensive school for a marginal increase in their income makes sense.

Inheritance seems highly unfair; however, I'm not sure the benefits of a higher inheritance tax would outweigh the costs.","It actually only kicked in after 5 million dollars in 2011.  I don't think many people ever reach that level of wealth, anyway. ",7132,14,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

Always remember the goal of estate tax is to wrest control of wealth from the few so that it can be re-distributed to the rest. The ultimate goal is to recycle productive assets back into the economy, rather than them piling up in the hands of a few wealthy families. Without the tax you will ultimately have children who live off of interest and dividends their parents earned. This creates an ever increasing disparity between the super rich and everyone else.

If you force people to spend their money before they die, you are stimulating growth and consumption. If rich old people pay their kids salaries as a means of avoidance, then the government gets a cut of payroll taxes. If they gift it before death, then the government gets the taxes sooner. Don't forget that life insurance companies aren't stupid. They won't offer absurdly large policies for people near death at extremely cheap rates. It will cost money which is ultimately being recycled back into the economy.

Business do not pay an estate tax. Businesses (if you're talking about corporations) have an unlimited life and distributions upon liquidation are taxed.

Your argument that education would become more expensive is incorrect. I don't know how you link the estate tax to rising costs in education. With that logic, EVERYTHING should become more expensive, but the reality is, the number of people who are actually paying estate tax in proportion to the number of people demanding services like education is very, very small. They will not drive up costs for those types of services.

There has always been a healthy fear among those who support the estate tax that increasing concentrations of wealth would create dynastic-like conditions for a select few families, who could then use their wealth to gain increasing control over the government. It is very important for the wealthy to realize that there must be enough opportunities (or at least the perception there are) for the poor to get ahead. Recent uprisings in the Middle East highlight this observation. When people feel the system is genuinely stacked against them, they start to protest. The rich can only insulate themselves from this chaos for so long.",7132,17,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

Unfortunately, this is a terrible place to base your assumptions from. Wealth is not finite, and neither is money.

Wealth is just a imaginary construction that we place around what we supposedly value (land, labor, capital, etc.) . I'm not making a commentary about the amount of wealth or money that exists. The economic and political implication of an estate tax is that it is intended to re-distribute wealth (which we implicate as being value/valuable things) back into society in some form of a ""fair"" way. I used the worse ""wrest"" rather forcefully, because nobody ""likes"" to pay taxes.

Issues that have arisen in past discussions include:

* In rhetorical circles, the *appeal to authority* is often considered a logical fallacy. Politics is not like science, where the work of people with experience has, by definition, undergone rigorous scientific scrutiny and testing. People with political degrees and/or experience in the field are often dead wrong, and it's only history that judges them. In fact, the history of government is littered with ""experts"" who turned out to be completely wrong.
* r/NeutralPolitics is supposed to be an evidence-based sub. If a comment doesn't link to a reliable source, then you should discount it, no matter who posted it. But conversely, if the comment is from someone who has no degree in the field, but links to reliable sources and forms a coherent argument, it should get upvoted. Flair could easily disrupt this system.
* How do you determine expertise? As an example, what happens if you get a learned economist who is schooled in a perspective that, although well-researched, is a minority view in the field. If you give him the ""economist"" flair, does that help or hinder readers when they see him arguing with someone who is not flaired, but is liberally quoting experts from a more mainstream school of thought? It would be easy in that case to favor the flaired commenter, even though his views might be on the fringe.
* The goal of the sub is to promote discussion so that people can make up their own minds about issues. We have no delusions that we're going to solve the world's problems here. To foster an inclusive discussion environment, everyone who provides good evidence and logic should be treated equally.
* We'd probably have to exempt the mods, a few of whom created this environment, but have no advanced degrees in the fields discussed here.

So in fact, you are wrong in terms of whether this will happen to *some* civilians, even if you are correct where *all* are concerned.  As a second order summation, it will at least be in O (x) no matter how low the coefficients are.

edit: Actually, to contradict myself and support weezer3989, this depends heavily on how we phrase the question.  The probability that it will happen to at least one person goes to 1 quickly, but the probability of whether it will happen as a general rule involves many more variables and is better represented by a family of wave functions.  The overall probability is then the sum of wave functions with a peak within a standard deviation of one over those without.  Whether this would go to 1 as a general rule is too complicated to formulate here, but I wouldn't count on it.

As it currently stands, it does not conform to our [submission rules,](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_submission_rules) but if you'd like to edit it a little, we'd be happy to approve it. Specifically, it needs a source and an adjustment to the title.

The source can simply support your premise. The post begins with, ""I have heard it claimed that..."" Where have you heard it? From whom? Please link to a qualified source (as defined in the guidelines) to support this claim, so all the participants can base their responses on the same information.

For the title, we discourage solicitations of opinion, because it gives people license to respond without evidence. You can just eliminate the ""In your opinion"" from the title and leave the rest. Unfortunately, that means you'll have to resubmit the post, because reddit doesn't allow you to edit titles of submissions.

This is an interesting question and could generate some good discussion. We hope you'll take the time to make those two adjustments and resubmit. If you have any questions, feel free to reply here.

And since you're acknowledging the subjectivity, perhaps instead of a source for the claim, you can just find a couple examples of referendum results that were referred to as ""decisive,"" then present the question of whether there's any kind of real standard.

* [This article](http://www.infoplease.com/news/2014/scotland-independence-referendum.html) about the 'no' vote on the 2014 Scottish independence referendum specifically states that a ""margin of victory of 10% is decisive.""

The program failed to find him and had a detrimental effect on the efforts to eradicate polio because it bred mistrust of health care workers.

As such, this operation seems like a complete failure. However, even if Osama bin Laden was the most wanted man in the world, and an elusive target, can programs such as these be justifiable?

And what about the use of resources? Can anyone be held accountable for wasteful programs like these when they're largely kept secret? It begs the question ""where are the auditors?"" both financial and moral?","A large problem in our government right now is that external auditors aren't allowed to exist with anything deemed secret. A court can't rule something banned when they can't make a ruling on it.

1215,"&gt; A large problem in our government right now is that external auditors aren't allowed to exist with anything deemed secret.

This actually isn't true (assuming you consider Congress to be ""external"" to the executive branch).

When the Cold War wound down, Congress put a great deal of pressure on the intelligence community to reduce waste and ensure mission success. Organizations like the NSA and NRO used to have black budgets with zero oversight outside of the executive branch. For the last 20 years, Congressional subcommittees have had direct oversight over classified budgets, and there's an apparatus in place that performs detailed legal, budgetary, and technical auditing of DoD and intelligence programs (the technical auditors are called FFRDCs). They exist outside the chain of military and intelligence command and appropriations, and their goals are to ensure mission success, reduce waste, and ensure the taxpayer is getting what Congress thinks it's paying for. In terms of success metrics, the auditing system works extremely well for most programs (e.g., US rocket launch success rates are significantly more successful than launches in other countries)

When we examine the details of the recent scandals, most of the real problems are when those high up in the government circumvent auditors. In the case of the (arguably illegal) [Trailblazer Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailblazer_Project), the original legal authorization came from documents drawn up by a non-government lawyer of VP Dick Cheney's, and then that program was separated from the regular auditing chains (there was a great recent NPR piece on this). The NSA was being explicitly told to do what it was doing, and the executive branch was telling it that their legal team had determined that their program was legal. When several NSA employees realized that the program must be illegal, their attempts to warn the auditors were squelched after being run up the chain of command to President Bush, VP Cheney, and then-Congressman Goss. 

From my perspective, one of the most concerning things about this whole NSA scandal is that these people did an end run around our legal auditors, and now they aren't being held accountable.",(pass),13341,2,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

###Source quality

* The preferred sources are academic articles from neutral organizations.
* Wikipedia should not be cited by an OP as the primary or solitary source. You can cite Wikipedia, but it can't be the only thing there.
* If your source is a news article, the publication should not be overly biased.
* Opinion pieces are tricky. Generally speaking, they don't generate useful discussion, but there are times when a well-referenced, unbiased exploration of an issue gets published as an opinion piece and does provide a good starting point. If your opinion piece itself doesn't provide sources, forget about posting it. 
* If your source is a book, link to a good summary or extensive review.
* Video sources are held to the same standards as text sources.
* No hearsay. The article must either contain a direct quote or a link to a direct quote that substantiates the position being attributed to the speaker. So, you can't call someone an anarchist unless you cite a quote where he calls himself an anarchist. (Thanks to /u/insomniaclyric for [proposing](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/17z8tj/meta_guidelines_for_source_quality_and_neutrality/c8afdsc) this rule.)

We do not maintain a ""blacklist"" of sources, because experience has shown that good articles occasionally show up in unlikely places. However, it is the responsibility of the poster or commenter to know the source's reputation and use extra care if quoting from a publication that's widely considered to be biased.

Re: operational significance

While it's true that Osama bin Laden's direct influence had waned by the time he died, it's important to keep in mind that we're not exactly fighting a normal war here. The wars in the Middle East are just as much wars of ideas as they are wars of ... well, shooting dudes. bin Laden's significance was not only in that he directed al Qaeda, but in that he was a symbol for al Qaeda - as [Bruce Riedel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Riedel) points out in [this article in the Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/how-the-killing-of-bin-laden-has-crippled-al-qaeda/256505/): 

&gt;There is no question a year after bin Laden's death that the al-Qaida core has been devastated by his loss, because he had achieved mythic status as the Robin Hood of international terrorism who the sheriff couldn't catch, and at the time of his death he was still the boss who ran the organization and kept its archives ... Now that myth has been destroyed and bin Laden has been brought to justice.

The article also points out that the organization has effectively been crippled by this - Osama bin Laden's replacement, al-Zawahiri, is nowhere near as effective as a symbol for new recruits. You can here another publication's take on that [here](http://www.dw.de/al-qaeda-still-suffers-from-bin-ladens-death/a-15921824). Key quote:

&gt;Osama bin Laden had a personality that was able to attract many young men in the Arabic world and also in the West and South Asia. Ayman al-Zawahiri is not inspiring. He is respected but he is not loved like bin Laden was.

And if you really want conventional success out of this operation, the Atlantic additionally points out -

&gt;[g]iven the treasure trove of intelligence gathered during the operation, it is probably no coincidence that the raid was followed by a series of successful strikes against senior bin Laden lieutenants....In fact, in roughly the last year U.S. intelligence officials claim to have killed half of al-Qaida's top 20 leaders in raids and attacks by armed drones...

Basically, tl;dr - Osama bin Laden absolutely should've been considered our top priority despite not having active operational significance. He was still their celebrity leader, and killing him removes a big symbol to any who wished to join him. As Riedel alluded to, it's hard to believe in Robin Hood's victory after he's been shot. 

Of course, there's a new problem of al-Qaeda affiliates becoming more empowered and separated. But  as these groups become more separated, I think they'll be much less effective. Feel free to challenge that opinion though, you never know how these things will develop.

Weighing the deaths of those unvaccinated against the lives  saved  by the war -

It's *really* hard  to make that  comparison when you're crafting policy. It's not like the CIA planned to sacrifice so many polio afflicted children to kill Osama bin Laden - if the plan goes well, then no innocents die as a result of distrust of vaccines, and the war is over sooner and we accomplish a primary military goal. If it doesn't, then we dismiss the claims as a conspiracy and hope people continue to get vaccines (and maybe radicals preventing them from doing so gets us more support in the war). 

Even if it was thought of as a direct trade off, it's really hard to predict the human lives lost and saved by ""some radicals become anti-vax"" and ""Osama bin Laden goes away"".  While it's easy to predict *some* or *many* will die, it's not as if there are clear results of these scenarios that can be drawn from  counter factuals before the  operation. 

----
Again, I think the operation was a mistake, and probably shouldn't have happened. I just don't think it's an inherently unjustified operation - if we had pulled it off, gotten information about Osama bin Laden, and not been discovered ( as was very possible ) this would have been amazingly helpful. 

It's worth remembering that [the operation Wikipedia lists was set up in Abbottabad, after we suspected bin Laden of hiding there, the year we killed him.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency#Use_of_vaccination_programs) We weren't just dicking around here. On the other hand, you can just as easily say the program wasn't needed at that point - in hindsight, I'd agree. I'm just not to upset we did it.

Have at it!","**Question 1:** The US is a big country with diverse and shifting interests. This brings complexity and nuance to the issues our representatives deal with in Washington. Does the whole idea of asking them to ""pledge"" something before they're elected lead to good policy? It seems like the resulting inflexibility would be a hindrance to good governance. 

**Answer:** It's a good question. People often say, The Americans for Tax Reform, the group that I head, asks all candidates for office — Federal, State, governors, state legislators, congressmen, senators, presidents — to sign a pledge to the American people, to the people of their state, and to the country, that they will oppose and vote against any effort to raise the tax burden, to raise taxes. The reason we do so is that the tendency of politicians is to expand the power of the government — State government, Federal government, city government — at the expense of consumers and taxpayers and citizens. And so, this is a commitment, saying, 'If I run for office, I may do many foolish things; I may invade small countries I can't pronounce, but I will not raise your taxes.' It doesn't answer all the world's questions, but it gets at quite a few of them. And the reason why you want to say to people, ""don't raise taxes,"" or you want them to make the commitment if they're willing to — I don't want someone promising you they won't raise taxes if they intend to raise taxes; the pledge is important and useful because people keep it when they run for office, and they make that commitment or they don't — 

The Constitution, as an example, is a collection of things the government is *not allowed to do.* There's a small list of things the government is supposed to do, and then a long list of amendment, the 10 parts of the Bill of Rights, are all things the government's not allowed to do. They're not allowed to tell you what church to go to. They're not allowed to tell you what you can say or can't say. They're not allowed come and rifle through your papers. They're not allowed to steal your guns or interfere with your Second Amendment rights. There's no ifs, ands or buts on this stuff. They're not allowed to. So I think you need restrictions on the power of government, whether it's a democracy or a monarchy, or however you choose your leaders, you want Constitutional restrictions on what that government is allowed to do and what they're forbidden from doing. And the pledge is a way to say, 'By the way, when you elect me, here's what I'm not going to do... I'm not going to raise your taxes.'

And that also tells you a lot about a candidate, because somebody who's not going to raise your taxes has to govern. Governing is making decisions on how much you spend and what you spend it on. Tax increasing is what politicians do rather than govern. 'We've been doing 100 different things, somebody wants to do one more thing... we'll just add it and raise taxes.'

Well, how about making decisions about what's important, what's less important? Are there things you've been doing for the last 20 years that don't make sense any more? Maybe they never made sense. Maybe they made sense 20 or 200 years ago, but not now. And so, the decision not to raise taxes is also the decision to reform government so that it costs less.

The whole thing that drives the Ryan budget plan — the Republican plan to reduce the size and scope of government, to block grant means-tested welfare programs (like Clinton did with Aid to Families with Dependent Children), and to fix entitlements so they don't bankrupt the country in years to come — was all driven by 'how do you do this without raising taxes?' And from that — ""we're not raising taxes"" — we got government reforms that will work and that I think will be very helpful.

OK, but the Constitution says, as Mr. Norquist himself pointed out in a later answer, that the government, through the House of Representatives, *is* allowed to raise taxes.

Were all those instances of Reagan failing to govern?

To some extent. Ideally those tax increases should have been paid with spending cuts. But Reagan was a President, not an absolutist king. He was very adept of getting legislative bipartisan support for his initiatives, unlike recent Presidents. 

The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act didn't actually raise taxes - it repealed tax cuts that had not yet taken place. The TEFRA passed the House with 226 votes - 123 from Republicans, 123 from Democrats. Reagan agreed to sign into law under the promise from Congress of a $3 reduction in spending for every $1 in increase in revenue. A pretty sweet deal, but Congress failed to deliver. - Source 1 [On the other hand, most of Dole's tax increase was actually the partial repeal of future tax cuts that had been enacted in 1981 but had not yet taken place. Despite Dole's bill, taxpayers received more than $375 billion in tax cuts over the following three years.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_gist/1996/08/the_biggest_tax_increase_in_history.html).

The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 was a bill introduced by a Democrat and sponsored by another 14. It passed the House with 268 to 155 and pretty much like the TEFRA, most of the revenue it raised came from repealing future tax cuts. - Basically the same sources.

&gt; I will: ONE, oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; *and TWO, oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates* [source](http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/Federal%20Pledge.pdf) pdf

That gives Congressmen enough leeway to work on tax restructuring -close loopholes and curb tax code expenditures- without violating the pledge. 

Overall, the tax burden declined during the Reagan Administration and most of the tax increases were repeals of scheduled tax cuts.

Your explanation of why capital gains revenues are expected to rise when taxes goes down does not negate the fact that they do and that Mr. Norquist was correct.

For your Jamie Dimon example you are saying good things in a way that makes them sound like bad things. If it is morally right for a man that makes $1,000 dollars a year to keep and use that money then why is it morally wrong for a man who makes 14 million to keep and use that money?
","&gt; when we do A then B always happens is an identification of a correlation and not a strict claim of causation.

Mr. Norquist's quote, referring to the general economy, was, ""Whenever we raise the capital gains tax, it's been damaged.""

I didn't say that was ""a strict claim of causation."" I, and Politifact, claimed it *implied* causation. I then wondered if Mr. Norquist cared to clarify the quote, which I half expected he might by doing exactly what you suggest... refuting the idea that he was implying or claiming causation. But no, he just piled on more correlations as evidence of causation.

&gt; Neither you or politifact proved that there was no causation.

You can't prove a negative.

&gt; Your explanation of why capital gains revenues are expected to rise when taxes goes down does not negate the fact that they do and that Mr. Norquist was correct.

In a sense, yes. He is correct that capital gains revenues rise and fall in response to changes in the capital gains tax rate. I think that's a pretty obvious byproduct of the fluctuation. But he's essentially answering his own question here, since the original quote said nothing about capital gains revenue. It was all about growth or damage to the overall economy.

&gt; If it is morally right for a man that makes $1,000 dollars a year to keep and use that money then why is it morally wrong for a man who makes 14 million to keep and use that money?

It's not morally wrong. But if either man uses that money to earn *more* money, then the gain (not the original principal, just the gain) is new income, and should be taxed as such. ""The same dollar"" should not be taxed. On that I agree with Mr. Norquist. But calling the gain on investment income ""the same dollar"" is misleading.

If the man who makes $1,000 puts that money in the bank, earns 10% interest, and withdraws $1,100 at the end of the year, only the $100 is subject to tax, not the original $1,000. Similarly, I believe Mr. Dimon's $1.4 million annual returns on investment should be taxed, but not the original $14 million invested.

As an aside, this is the kind of exchange I wish we could have had with Mr. Norquist. Thank you for engaging.

**Answer:** Actually, I am in favor of just that. If you're looking at Congressman Dave Camp, is the Republican in the House who runs the Weighs and Means Committee, the tax writing committee. Under the Constitution, only the House can introduce tax changes, up or down or reform. His tax reform moves in exactly that direction. It's not all spelled out, but we have a fairly good idea of the direction they're going and I think you'll be very pleased with the proposal that he puts forward in terms of moving in the right direction. Maybe not as far as you or I would go, but everybody should pay the same marginal tax rates, not different for different people.

We do have a challenge. We have a 35% top corporate rate, OK? I just had a presentation in our Wednesday meeting here in D.C.  There's a gentleman from Hungary who runs a think tank there. They have a 16 percent marginal tax rate there, in Hungary. We're 35, Hungary's 16. And then, the Swedes were there. There at, I think, 22 percent. Swedes are at 22, we're at 35. This is not reasonable. The European average, OECD countries, is at 25. We should move to 25 as the opening bid. Stupider than France is not where we want to be on tax policy.

**Answer:** For the first part, there are lots of tax deductions that I think I would rather move away from and have lower rates. One proposal that was put forward I think years ago by Steven Moore - now writing for The Wall Street Journal editorial page - which was to set up an alternative tax code. So you have the present tax code which is a mess and has thousands of pages and a second tax code [that is] optional, optional [where if] you like the present system? Stay there. Be happy. You want to move over to the other one permanently - you can't do it one year and then change back and forth - but you can choose the other one and have one simple rate and few, if any, deductions in credits. So you could go very radical in the limitation on how many deductions and credits you have because it's an option. I would like to live in a world where the government doesn't advantage or disadvantage any activities, one simple very low rate, and I think most people over time would in fact shift to the low rate with few deductions or credits. I realize that some people have organized their lives by how they've structured things, by buying a big house, and other stuff that you do because they're tax advantages. Well, over time you might want to shift and not live for the tax rules but live for how you want to make decisions not how tax writing committees want to make decisions for you. So I think that that it would be a good idea to move towards few deductions and credits but I like that idea of making it an option. You want to stay in the present mess? You can. The rest of us may want to move over to the simpler code system. But it doesn't scare anybody because if somebody thinks ""Oh, I've got this tax credit that's important to me"" then please, stay there. Nobody's telling you that you have to do anything other than what you're doing.

Answer for Part 2:

Tax reductions/tax cuts taking the top rate from 90/70, from 70/50, from 50/20, every time we did those things the government would have more money from rich people because people paid more in taxes because they worked more and because they didn't try and organize their lives around hiding from the tax rates. And so that actually raises revenue but it is a tax cut. I don't think you can look somebody in the eye and say ""We're going to tax you at 90, we're now going to tax you at 70 and that's a tax increase"". It's a tax rate cut that, actually because of economic growth, helps the entire economy and the government ends up raising more money with a lower rate. So, cutting the capital gains tax and cutting the income tax rates, cutting the business tax rates, going to faster depreciation or expensing for business investment, all those things are cuts in taxes but they actually raise money for the government because they're so helpful to strengthening the overall economy.","That first answer terrifies me, and I hope he didn't think that through.

**Answer:** OK, one, wealthy nations like to spend more on health care because they can, because they can afford it.

The government ought not be in the business of telling you what your insurance should look like. You should decide.

But, if Obamacare had never happened, we had a mess before Obamacare. It wasn't as big a mess, but it was still a mess. And you had 50 states — some people say 57, but at least 50 states — where each of those states set up a bunch of rules, and said 'if you want to sell insurance in New Jersey,' there were I think 48 different mandates: you have to insure for this and this.

Well, what if I don't want to insure for all sorts of different things and uh, drug rehabilitation. I don't want to pay for that because it's not something I'm going to make use of, or for various other things that I'm not interested in? I want to be able to choose what I insure for, not have the government tell me I have to. And the reason some states, like New Jersey, have more than Iowa, is that the legislature, and so on, are more corrupt, and they've got all these special interests coming in saying, ""make everybody who buys insurance use my stuff."" And that's where these mandates come in. And Obama did that in a big way with Obamacare. There's lots of stuff you have to pay for that you may have no interest in that subsidizes some special interest because Obama's rule-makers make you pay for something you don't want to pay for, and that raises the cost.

Somewhat off topic, but I would like to raise the seldom raised point that the one reason health care is so expensive in America is the shortage of doctors. Medical schools currently have a 3% acceptance rate. They are turning away 'straight A students'. This number only reflects the number that applied and ignores the multitudes that don`t even apply, scared of the 60K+ per semester tuition costs.

Its simple supply and demand. We need nurse practitioners to take over primary care as a quick fix but long term we need more doctors. We need more medical schools. We need to lower education costs.

Its no secret; the AMA is against opening new schools and has been for a while. I don't blame them with the average salary of 250k-500k a year as an MD I would be against training new competition too.

Every source of energy should be allowed to compete on a level playing field."" Can you expand upon ATR's goal of expanding America's energy supply?

**Answer:** That got to the earlier question we were talking about where I oppose, and Americans for Tax Reform opposes, all special subsidies, tax breaks, for particular industries. There are a whole bunch of subsidies for so-called green energy or alternative energy sources, and some tax breaks for oil or natural gas. Get rid of all that stuff. Get rid of all of those special deals, and just say, 'hey, you want to bring natural gas or oil or nuclear or wind power or magic bean power or whatever you've got and sell it to people, then do so, but don't be asking for a subsidy; just do it.'

So I think it's very important that we... now there's a lot of stuff... fracking... we can now find natural gas in places nobody thought they had it before. All sorts of States are doing it. New York has decided not to do it in New York, but in Pennsylvania a lot of people are producing... 10 percent of the natural gas in the country is now being made in Pennsylvania, which did not used to be thought of as some cross between Qatar and Kuwait or something, but Pennsylvania is now doing quite well. A lot of people are getting rich... farmers and stuff, 'cause they have to poke a whole in your farmland and they have to pay for it.

So, I think there's some great stuff. There's a lot of energy in Alaska and the Alaskans get very whiny when a bunch of rich liberals sitting in New York City who've never been to Alaska decide that they can't poke holes in the ground in Alaska and get oil and sell it to people. I think that's kind of silly and it's kind of imperialistic to run other people's lives from afar and tell them what they can and can't do with their own property and their own stuff.

So, I think we should be drilling off shore. The only way California's ever going to get out of its bankrupt situation, where the underfunded liabilities of the government worker pension system, which is bankrupting the state — and it's gotten worse, not better, under Governor Brown and recent situations — is to tap all that lovely underground oil and natural gas that's off shore, like they do in Britain and Norway. But very carefully, making sure you don't damage any birds or anything, but that would solve much, if not all of, the California problem that's otherwise going to break the taxpayers of the State, or move everybody with a job to Arizona, Nevada and Wyoming.

So, I think there's a lot we can do on energy. The government just has to get out of their way. The government doesn't have to do anything. You've got a project, 'I've got a project.' What does it require? The government's got to be really smart and... whoops, that's not gonna work, is it?

A source besides Wikipedia that discusses the history behind HIPAA would also be very helpful; HHS.gov provides a good overview of when HIPAA came into play and what it covers. Archived news sources from around that time may also be good, if you can find them. The References section on the Wikipedia page would be a good place to start. Since you're also discussing the Equifax scandal, you should provide a source or two (not Wikipedia) on that, as well.

In general, when posting in /r/NeutralPolitics, there's no need to provide personal background as to why you're asking a certain question. Rather, we need to see the *politically relevant* background of the issue. If you look back through the submissions on the sub, they tend to follow the same format: question (in the title and/or the submission itself), presentation of facts and/or history (with appropriate sources), then question again (usually rephrased or more detailed). It's not a rule for the sub, but it helps to ensure that the rules we have are followed appropriately.

Let me know if you have any more questions. You can edit this post to get the content perfect first, or you can go ahead and submit a new post with edits and a revised title to go through our typical editing process (or possibly get approved straight away), which may be with a different mod.","How's this?

So what? That says nothing about whether confidentiality is helpful for negotiations.

&gt; The relative benefits of competing options cannot be weighed by society if they are not made a part of the process.

That's false and irrelevant. It's false because observers *can* evaluate things in which they don't participate: You or I, as private citizens, absolutely can comment on the merits of a final proposed trade deal despite not having been privy to or having direct input on negotiations. *Even if* we didn't have some input, we could still judge the deal.

But it's irrelevant because we *do* have input, through our elected representatives. This isn't a deal made by kings and queens to which we serfs are helplessly subject. 

The deal in question isn't just going to automatically become law. All fast track does is require Congress to make a Yes or No vote on the deal. We absolutely have a say in whether the deal goes through because we elected this President and we elected this Congress. And the final proposed deal will be exposed to the light of day, with everyone who wants being able to read it, say anything they want about it, and write their representatives about it if they so choose.

First of all, the ""better way"" I'm asking about doesn't equate to having the parties' ""questions, opinions, and even ignorance be 100% exposed to the public for commentary and feedback."" That strikes me as a straw man.

Secondly, a jury deliberation is not a negotiation. It's an examination of the facts to decide about some very specific questions of law. And the parties aren't representing their interests or those of their constituencies, they're trying to determine the fate of a single person.

[26 U.S. Code § 501 - Exemption from tax on corporations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501) defines the qualifying criteria on fully tax-exempt religious organizations as such:

&gt; [Any religious] foundation, organized and operated exclusively for religious... purposes..., no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation..., and which does not participate in, or intervene in..., any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.  

The stated purpose of the Executive Order Sec. 2. is, ""Respecting Religious and Political Speech"" -- i.e. so as to allow this sort of political activism under the protection of constitutional free speech without any threat or action of revocation of tax-exempt status as a 501(c)-3 organization.  

---
There is some important context to consider:  

First, being a 501(c)-3 organization means that not only is the organization's income tax-exempt, but **also the donations of individuals to the foundation are tax-deductible to those individuals.**  

Second, there are other provisions under this section of the tax code that still provide tax-exempt status on the organization's income (e.g. 501(c)-4). The ~~only~~ relevant difference is that the **individual donations would no longer be tax-deductible for those individuals.** The tax-exempt status of the organization's income would remain intact under other, similar classifications that are not impacted by the Johnson Amendment.

Third, in approximately the last 20 years, not one 501(c)-3 organization has had its status as such revoked as a result of violating the Johnson Amendment.

That third point ostensibly demonstrates that, in effect, the Johnson Amendment already doesn't exist as it is not being enforced. Therefore the Executive Order effectively accomplishes very little of substance with regard to ""Respecting Religious and Political Speech"".

That is, endorse a specific candidate and tell your flock how to vote. 

However, some churches go out of their way to record themselves saying just this, and mail these tapes to the IRS saying, essentially, ""Try me."" Since 2008, this has been organized as ""Pulpit Freedom Sunday"". To my knowledge, the IRS says this is something that can make a religious organization lose its non-profit status, but they have maybe only done it once (when a church place an ad in the USA Today saying it would be sinful to vote for Clinton comma Bill) and officially stopped all investigations since 2009 (Thanks, Obama?):

&gt;It was after the IRS lost a 2009 lawsuit over its procedural process in investigating the Living Word Christian Center following the church's endorsement of former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., that the agency halted investigations, according to Politico.

&gt;The IRS sued the church for refusing to hand over its records, but a judge threw out the case over the fact that a regional commissioner should have been approving church audits. The job, however, had been axed from the agency ranks, meaning that the government was using lower-level IRS staffers, which the judge said was inappropriate.

That's from a real good [*Deseret News* (close to the Mormon Church) article about the issue](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865658366/The-long-2-and-surprising-2-history-behind-the-IRS-ban-on-churches-endorsing-political-candidates.html), which gives a great history. Repealing the Johnson Amendment was in the Republican Platform in 2016. (Ironically, it seems the Johnson amendment was [adopted in 1954 to prevent two *secular* non-profit organizations from campaigning against Johnson](http://blogs.christianpost.com/liberty/the-johnson-amendment-is-a-fat-opossum-2881/).)

Whether this EO weakens or strengthens the Johnson Amendment frustratingly depends on legal interpretation, but it [may further weaken the already neutered Johnson Amendment](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/trump-ease-tax-rules-religious-groups-may-endorse-political-candidates/) and, at the very least, should be seen as a signal to Evangelicals and other conservative religious groups that they can safely ignore the Johnson Amendment. 

&gt;Ralph Reed, a longtime evangelical leader and founder of the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition, said he was briefed by White House officials about the text of the executive order. [...]

&gt;“This administratively removes the threat of harassment.”
Reed said he was “thrilled” by the language on the IRS restrictions on partisan political activity. “This administratively removes the threat of harassment,” Reed said in a phone interview. “That is a really big deal.” He said the language in the order related to the preventive care mandate will “ensure that as long as Donald Trump is president, that something like the Little Sisters of the Poor case will never happen again.”

The Little Sisters of the Poor is a separate issue(Section 3), and I was mainly talking about Sections 2 and 4. So I disagree with all those that say it doesn't actually do anything. It, at the very least, is a strong signal. That's certainly how people like Reed are taking it, after all. ",(pass),6759,17,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
1437,"That's a document from 1993 (notice the title and that it cites things from 1989, 1991, and 1992, but nothing after) which I believe is thoroughly outdated. Do you have anything more current? From everything I've read, nothing in the last twenty years resembles that at all. Again, literally one church is known to have lost its tax-exempt status due to political activities.  From what I know, I believe these sorts of issue-based discussions are relatively common, and the recent interpretation of the rule has generally been that it's outright political endorsements which are treyf, ""issue-based"" advocacy is kosher. From that PBS article cited above:

&gt;The regulation, named for then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson, was put into force in 1954 and prohibited partisan political activity for churches and other tax-exempt organizations. The policy still allows a wide range of advocacy on political issues, but in the case of houses of worship, it bars electioneering and outright political endorsements from the pulpit. The rule has rarely been enforced.

&gt;The IRS does not make public its investigations in such cases, but only one church is known to have lost its tax-exempt status as a result of the prohibition. The Church at Pierce Creek in Conklin, New York, was penalized for taking out newspaper ads telling Christians they could not vote for Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election. Even so, some religious leaders have argued the rule has a chilling effect on free speech, and have advocated for years for repeal.","&gt; which I believe is thoroughly outdated

Trump (et al) has degraded this term to refer to any presentation of facts that are distasteful.  

Here, the ACLU has used the term here to refer to a (campaign) lie, or a statement of intent that he has failed to make real, further degrades the term.

When he is saying this order ""totally destroys"" the Johnson Amendment, when it really doesn't, and his statements are meant to make it seem like he's taking hard action against 'attacks on religion', would that not be a) distortion of the truth and b) reshaping what reality shows?

Think of it this way: if you saw a Breitbart article exclaiming that Trump's executive order totally destroyed the Johnson Amendment and has struck a strong blow for religious liberty, would you not call that fake news? It's fiction. It's false. It really does not do that. It's more than a distasteful presentation, it distorts the truth in a way that misleads its audience.

However, these countries also spend tiny fractions of their already small GDPs on defense. Norway spends 7.2b (1.4%), Finland spends 2.7b (1.3%), Switzerland spends 4.83b (.7%), Denmark spends 3.7b (~1.3%) and Sweden spends 5.7b (~1.1%). These numbers are all adjusted to USD.

What additional funds would be available if military spending was cut to NATO recommended levels, or Sweden's? NATO recommends 2% of GDP, which would be roughly $340 billion, $276 million less than current levels. 0.7% would be around $119 billion, a potential savings of $497 billion.

Norway is around 5 million people, Sweden around 9.5 and Finland also around 5.

The United States by contrast, spans a continent and has a population 17 times larger. 
Nordic states, are very productive and exceptional places to live, but (and yes I am generalizing here) bureaucracies can remain small and lean by comparison. A Federal attempt to set up social programs like those in Sweden would be absolutely gargantuan projects, ministering to a group probably orders of magnitude larger than the entire Nordic population. This is not to say that it is bad, but rather only point out what is in my view the main obstacle. 

For the Nordic countries, I doubt a large enough tax base exists for them to acquire and maintain the strategic systems necessary to deter a country like...Russia. They all rely upon mutual self defense and some rely upon NATO. I think if the Nordic countries did up defense spending to 2%, the marginal benefit wouldn't be that great. Maybe each country might stand up a new Brigade or Regiment or increase readiness rates or something, but in strategic terms, this isn't disruptive.

1554,"Here's a history. Excerpt:

&gt;The deductibility of state and local taxes is older than the current federal income tax itself. The provision has its origin in the nation’s first effort at income taxation (eventually found unconstitutional) under the Civil War-financing Revenue Act of 1862, and was carried over into the Revenue Act of 1913, the post-Sixteenth Amendment legislation creating the modern individual income tax. The rationale for the original provision only comes down to us in fragments, though a fear that high levels of federal taxation might “absorb all [the states’] taxable resources,” a concern first addressed in the Federalist Papers, appears to have held sway.

I will happily defend that moral assertion.  But you'll note, that in this long thread, not a single person has offered a MORAL defense of why someone making 100k in alabama should pay more federal tax than someone making 100k in new york.  When pressed, they all fall back on some other argument

&gt;Fundamentally, our tax dollars are to be used, as the Constitution puts it, to provide and promote the common welfare.

that's not what the constitution says.  

&gt;Similarly, federal grants are given to those states that have trouble providing for their own citizens. This comes in many forms from welfare programs given to directly to individuals (like medicaid, financial assistance, food stamps, and energy assistance), to larger programs targeted at whole communities (like education grants to local schools, grants to cities to build infrastructure, and farm subsidies). Some states, however, are better able to provide for their own citizens and do not need to receive as much money from the federal government to assist with these programs. Generally these states can better provide for their citizens because they pay more in state taxes.

Let's assume this is the case.  In that case, you should be in favor of abolishing salt.   Your argument here is, essentially, that some states are too poor to pay for a decent lives for themselves, and need help.  Alright, that's a consistent, sound argument.  what isn't sound is to ""some states are too poor, and they need help, so they should be taxed more and their own money given back to them as aid.""  If you truly believe that the richer states should help the poorer, then the LAST thing you should want is SALT, since it generally transfers money away from poorer states.  ","&gt; But you'll note, that in this long thread, not a single person has offered a MORAL defense of why someone making 100k in alabama should pay more federal tax than someone making 100k in new york.

I believe I did make that argument. The moral argument is that I am paying the state to provide certain services that the federal government offers. If I am paying the state to give me those services, why should I also need to pay the government for those services?

&gt;&gt; Fundamentally, our tax dollars are to be used, as the Constitution puts it, to provide and promote the common welfare.

 &gt;that's not what the constitution says.

Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution:

""The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States;""


&gt; Let's assume this is the case. In that case, you should be in favor of abolishing salt.

Alright, that's a consistent, sound argument. what isn't sound is to ""some states are too poor, and they need help, so they should be taxed more and their own money given back to them as aid."" If you truly believe that the richer states should help the poorer, then the LAST thing you should want is SALT, since it generally transfers money away from poorer states.

That would be a valid argument if states were destined for some reason to always be poor and unable to pay for their own programs. But a major reason why they are too poor to pay for their programs is that their state and local taxes are too low, and thus they require more aid from the federal government. If they had higher taxes and spent that money on these programs, they wouldn't need to spend receive so much money from the federal government and everyone's federal taxes could be lower. Why should the people of my state subsidize another state for their own fiscal irresponsibility?


You see, I am of the opinion that a person knows best how to spend their own money, followed by their municipality, then their state, and finally the federal government. I am absolutely fine with higher state and local taxes if it means fewer federal taxes, because my state and locale can better address my needs in a much more efficient manner than the federal government can. What I don't like is the federal government robbing Peter to pay Paul. Removing the SALT deduction is taking the money away from me so it can go to the federal government which will then give it to a state that doesn't want be fiscally responsible and pay for its own programs.",7340,109,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

&gt;and I pointed out that that argument is simply wrong.  The states and feds provide different services.  You aren't paying twice, you're paying for two different sets of things.

That is not always the case. Often times, the feds grant money to states to pay for state services. That is in fact  how almost all block grants work.


&gt;&gt;Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution:
&gt;
&gt;Common welfare and general welfare are not the same thing.  General welfare is a specific, and legally loaded, phrase.  

Not, it really isn't. In fact, one of the reasons that clause is so controversial is that general welfare is not defined anywhere and can be as broad or narrow as the interpereter wants it to be. Madison, for instance, favored the narrow inteperetation, while Hamilton argued that it meant Congress coupd lay wahetever taxes they wanted so long as it would provide benefit to the nation.

&gt;&gt;But a major reason why they are too poor to pay for their programs is that their state and local taxes are too low, 
&gt;
&gt;I'm pointed out the MANY ways this assertion is wrong.  please stop making it.

No, you didn't. You just said they were wrong without giving any reason. Looks at the data: states that have higher taxes receive tend to receive less block grants and aid from the federal government. That is a fact. My argument is that this is, in part, because their higher state and local taxes are paying for programs that would otherwise be funded in part by block grants from the federal government.


&gt;&gt;Why should the people of my state subsidize another state for their own fiscal irresponsibility? 
&gt;
&gt;They shouldn't.  And if you think they are, the proper response is to abolish the programs you think they are abusing, not force them to pay taxes for programs that they don't want. 

I am also in favor of that, but given as that is not going to happen, it is a stupid idea to raise  people's taxes to pay for the fiscal irresponsibility of other states.

&gt; Your argument amounts to saying that you should tax people on welfare for the cost of the their welfare, in order to teach them not to use welfare. it's incoherent.

My argument is that states should be fiscally responsible and pay for their own programs rather than expect other states to give them handouts.

Two, there is no state that ""keeps cutting taxes."" state and local taxes have done nothing but increase. for decades. States will occasionally elect a government that cuts things back for a year or two in a recession, but it never stops the long term upward trend.

Three, while the red states are poorer than the blue for a long time, they have been growing much faster for the last few decades. The blue states are not investing in long term growth, they'd living on inherited capital, and in some cases, rapidly spending it down.

If we think of deduction as an economic incentive to do the ""right"" thing then SALT deductions might make more sense. Items such as student loan interest, charitable donations,  and medical costs are deductible because we want people to educate themselves, help out the less fortunate, and help prevent medically induced poverty. We increase tax on cigarettes, alcohol, and other behaviors we want to discourage. The criticism of the estate tax is that it double taxes income, but we justify this because we are trying to discourage the accumulation of excessive generational wealth. Alternatively, SALT deductions remove the double taxing of income because we want to encourage states to be pro-active in improving schools and roads, and increasing their emergency slush funds.

The argument that's been coming up in this thread is that, as I understand it, SALT is an incentive for more local governance which blue states are taking advantage of more often than red states, and that this explains the differences in federal funding. So instead of removing SALT, red states should just raise their taxes and replace federal programs with (presumably more efficient) local ones.

If you look at the analysis on the pages being linked, though, federal dependency depends on how rich or poor a state is much more than that state's tax rates. Tax rates or tax burdens correlate quite weakly with federal dependency* while tax income, average SALT deduction, or other things measured in dollars show a stronger correlation since they include an effect from that state's GDP and not just the state's tax policy.

So if federally dependent states can't wean themselves off that funding by raising taxes, then this particular argument for defending SALT doesn't seem coherent.

\* Take the numbers from WalletHub and throw them in Excel or otherwise look at the correlations yourself. Total tax burden vs federal dependency is *r* = -0.15, or *r* = -0.20 if you go by rank. That seems too low to draw serious conclusions from to me.

So if federally dependent states can't wean themselves off that funding by raising taxes, then this particular argument for defending SALT doesn't seem coherent.

\* Take the numbers from WalletHub and throw them in Excel or otherwise look at the correlations yourself. Total tax burden vs federal dependency is *r* = -0.15, or *r* = -0.20 if you go by rank. That seems too low to draw serious conclusions from to me. 

EDIT: In fact, here's a [picture](https://imgur.com/a/H8dF1), color coded for how each state voted in 2016 (and omitting Delaware since it's an outlier/tax haven, which improves the numbers a little but we're still looking at r = -0.24).",(pass),7340,130,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
1684,"&gt;I bet if you normalize both axis 0-1 and plot a line y=x, you will find that Red states cluster on the low tax-federally dependent side of the curve.

You're not wrong. [Scaled](https://imgur.com/a/V2r81), with quadrants and y=x sloppily added in paint.

However, while red states are more likely overall to have lower tax burdens their federal dependencies are still all over the map. West Virginia and Mississippi already have above average tax burdens but they're some of the most dependent states, for example. Meanwhile Florida, Alaska, and Oklahoma are in the low dependence quadrant but have some of the lowest tax burdens on the graph (and Alaska is unusual, sure, but Oklahoma?)

Ultimately, though, I don't think our interpretations of the data are incompatible. It's possible for red states to be more dependent *and* for dependency to be mostly independent from tax policy. Blue states are less dependent but have a wide range of tax burdens. Red states have lower taxes and a wide range of dependency. The result is that red states are more likely to be dependent than blue ones, but not that high dependency red states could change this by raising taxes (since plenty of low dependency red states have similar or lower tax rates.)

Eliminating SALT is almost certainly a partisan move that will redistribute wealth from blue states to red ones. That doesn't automatically make the federal dependency argument for SALT deductions correct, however, *even if* blue states are less dependent on average.

(If you compared what each state *spends* its tax revenue on it might be the case that red states aren't spending effectively, which you could model by artificially lowering their tax burdens depending on some efficiency gap. I'm not keen on looking into that, since it's much thornier, but it might give you the correlation you want. Then you're in the tenuous position of hoping red states will raise taxes to fund programs that red states are traditionally against, though. That's less an argument in favor of SALT deductions and more of an argument for stronger federal regulation to bring backwards states up to par.)","You turned that graph around quick!

So I guess you are thinking from a pure calculus of the number stand point, I'm coming at it from more of a social angle. Let say you live and pay taxes in a Blue state, with high taxes and the following conditions happen:

1.) Red states tend to get back more than they give from the federal government

2.) The federal government, controlled by Republicans, will be effectively raising taxes for people in high tax states which tend to be blue by getting rid of one of the oldest parts of the income tax code. 

The first point alone is a tolerable injustice, but when you get to 2), it crosses a line for some since it seems to accelerate the injustice of 1). There was a famous experiment with [Capuchin monkeys on this topic](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/02/27/283348422/that-s-unfair-you-say-this-monkey-can-relate). Its called [social inequality aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequity_aversion) and it could be corrosive to people living in high performing (GDP), high state tax, blue states like CA or NY. This could result in the metaphorical ""throwing back of the Cucumber"", that is, blue states start to invest less in infrastructure and education to become more on par with places like Alabama or Kentucky. Turning California into the next Alabama or New York into the next Kentucky is effectively an economic nightmare scenario for the nation.

Or here:

&gt; Why California can the total collected in federal tax be 100 billion, and the total recieved in federal aid be 85 billion, but in Alabama the total collected can be 30 billion and total recieved in aid be 45 billion?

My point is California is a rich state, yet homeowners protecting their home value have made California unlivable for the working and middle class due to land use restrictions and a refusal to build up. The COL is a completely self imoposed problem, and it needs to be solved through  state policy that has nothing to do with balance of Federal Payments. I'm in California currently. I'm renting and earning in the 15% bracket and Im personally looking forward to my expanded standard deduction, lower bracket, and child tax credit expansion. Maybe with the legs chopped out from the MID prices will stabilized and I'll be able to purchase a home here someday.

1701,"&gt; but what in the fuck does that have to do with this tax bill specifically targeting blue states and creating a larger imbalance at the federal level

The imbalance does not exist because Federal tax policy targets blue states. The imbalance exists because  federal tax policy is progressive and taxes the wealthy in order to pay benefits to the poor. Coincidentally, the wealthy are concentrated in blue states, and the poor in red states. It also tends to build military bases in areas where land is cheap so you can have a lot of it. Surprise surprise, land is much cheaper in Georgia then California (although California does have several incredibly large bases). 

&gt; I don't see what the discussion of the tax bill, are you arguing it will have a positive effect on the cost of living? Because there no basis for that.

What I mentioned was the effects on weakening the Mortgage Interest Deduction (MID). Housing cost is the biggest factor in overall cost of living, especially in California. Yet the MID [has no effect on home ownership, it just pushes people to get larger and more expensive houses](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137712000514). By weakening this incentive, the federal government gets out of the game of distorting housing values and driving up the COL. 

&gt; I don't think people like you realize that the cause of high prices in California is crazy demand with tons of people moving here and the occurance of high salaries. You can fomain about policy all day long but that is 95% of the reason prices are high. Also show me somewhere where home owners don't protect their home prices.

Cost of living is a supply and demand problem. If salaries rise, so does demand. But if the state doesn't let the housing supply rise to meet demand, or energy production rise to meet demand, or any number of other goods now being competed by between more dollars then prices will rise. As to people moving here, [California has a big outmigration problem](http://www.ocregister.com/2017/04/23/leaving-california-after-slowing-the-trend-intensifies/) with 12,000 people net leaving the bay area last year. 

As to showing somewhere homeowners don't protect prices [here's a chart to what states have the most and least land use restrictions] (https://www.freedominthe50states.org/custom/land-use/frent/frtp/fwrluri/mindex). CATO is definitely right leaning, but its data is from the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index which from a cursory google search appears to be solid. So to answer your question as to where homeowners don't protect their home prices the answer is probably nowhere, but the NIBYism of Red States doesn't hold a candle to that of California and the North East. 

&gt; You must make nothing if the new standard deduction and child tax credit cancels out the SALT deduction for you to even out and get a couple hundred bucks back, cause for the vast majority of us here it raises our taxes.

Does it? Granted my households cash compensation is only 64k, but that's barely below [median household income statewide], although I guess I'm about 10k shy of median family income for a family of 4. I'm better off than many Californians though because I have a good benefit package and healthcare, so I would venture to say I am probably around average if not above it. Using [this calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator#JtpTIVU9W7) my estimated state sales, income, and fuel taxes for 2017 are a bit over 4,000. Nowhere near where I would need to be to consider itemizing, its the MID that would probably make it worth my while. We can argue all day about what's middle class in California, but the term is so overused its almost meaningless at this point. For those in California and in the middle who can't afford to buy a home, this bill really doesn't impact them, and depending on the size of the child tax credit could actually help, maybe even to cover the new gas tax we're all coughing up now.","I stopped reading here:

Maybe, but I'm not making that argument. I'm saying eliminating the SALT deduction will drive behaviors that will interfere with some State's ability to collect revenue. It can be a simple as: now that people can't deduct SALT, the state has no choice but to cut taxes or lose tax base. Perhaps there are good reasons for the State to tax and spend as they do.

The GGM Model developed by Seth G. Benzell, Laurence J. Kotlikoff
, and Guillermo Lagarda along with a few other economists shows that, or at least claims 3-5% higher economic growth and $3,500 in average wage growth. I think most of the authors work for Boston University but I could be wrong. Maybe its incorrect, but lots if not all economic models tend to be.

When Morsi first gained power and everyone was freaking out about how Egypt was turning Islamic extremest he laid out a timeline of what will happen. Morsi will gain power, start laying in religious laws while ignoring the economy and will suffer a huge backlash. ","I'm going to try to specifically address the reason as to why Egyptians are protesting as opposed to why they should be upset about things. There are plenty of countries with crippling un/underemployment, oppressive regimes, etc., and you don't see mass protests like those in Egypt. So I'm going to specifically attempt to address the mobilization factor in the Egyptian context.

**Economic woes**

This [NYT summary](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/21/opinion/egypts-economic-crisis.html?_r=0) should provide you with decent context. This line in particular is, in my mind, the crux of the matter: ""Egyptians want jobs, education and a say in governance."" These are all interconnected. The economic issues have backing in previous economic structures and the educational system.

Prior to the 2011 Revolution, Egypt was heavily dependent on two sources of income: tourism and foreign direct investment. Pre-revolution tourism accounted for around 11% of Egypt's GDP according to the OECD (cited in this [BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21293299)) Donors (and tourists) began to withdraw their investment from the country in droves in light of continued ongoing instability. This has contributed to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound and recent oil shortages.

Second, wealth in Egypt is highly concentrated in wealthy families and the military. This is not an argument will hear mentioned in Egyptian discourse, but a large issue with implementing any meaningful structural reform is challenging the stakeholders that benefit from the status quo. Zeinab abul-Magd wrote recently of this  in [Foreign Policy](http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/05/08/the_egyptian_republic_of_retired_generals). The largest issue is, as she states: 

&gt;Moreover, retired generals manage the vast enterprises owned by the military institution and produce goods and services for consumers rather than for military production. This includes chains of factories, service companies, farms, roads, gas stations, supermarkets, and much more. There are three major military bodies engaged in civilian production: the Ministry of Military Production, running eight factories; the Arab Organization for Industrialization, running 12 factories; and the National Service Products Organization, running 15 factories, companies, and farms. They produce a wide variety of goods, including luxury jeeps, infant incubators, butane gas cylinders, plastic tubes, canned food, meat, chicken, and more. They also provide services, like domestic cleaning and gas station management. 

In sum, the Egyptian economy is poorly structured and dependent on the state for economic dynamism, and the vested interests at the top have no interest in changing the status quo. This is combined with the fact that for years, Egyptian standards of living were increasing and are now being eroded by the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. Expectations are increasingly misaligned with reality, forcing average Egyptians to attempt to find redress through the state that largely created said expectations.

**Education**
One of Gamal Abdel Nasser's greatest contributions to Egyptian society was easing access to primary and secondary education. Colleges were made free to all pending successful passage of the Egyptian exam system. While in principle this is excellent, this sort of plays into the economic issues discussed above. Average Egyptians for years were essentially guaranteed jobs in government prior to the infitah (opening) reforms of Sadat and Mubarak. Economic restructuring forced the Egyptian government to cut public sector jobs and privatize government services that previously supplied jobs to Egyptian business majors and attorneys, as well as (and perhaps most notably) college-educated women. It can easily be argued that these reforms needed to be made, but the underlying reason for the job programs' existence was not addressed by the regime. As a result, there are vast sums of well-educated younger Egyptians (your prime ""revolutionary class,"" so to speak) that are currently unemployed, or more often underemployed and working in tourism or unrelated sectors. When the tourism sector was devastated following the revolution, these jobs became even less readily available than before. Just as an anecdote to demonstrate the extent of underemployment in Egypt, when I lived there in 2010, the person who installed the internet in my apartment in Cairo was an attorney by training.

**Polarization**
I would argue the catalyst for the recent protests has been the extent to which elements of Egyptian society have become detached from one another. Nathan Brown highlights this in his [recent piece](http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/06/27/will_june_30_be_midnight_for_morsis_cinderella_story) for Foreign Policy written immediately prior to the June 30 protests:

&gt;Egyptian politics now seems to operate in two parallel universes. On the one side is a simple story of a president and ruling political party that suffered years of oppression but were finally rewarded by the Egyptian people for their endurance, dedication, and honesty. Endowed with clear democratic and constitutional legitimacy -- and brought to power on the heels of a popular uprising that his movement helped lead -- President Morsi suddenly faces an array of forces who wish to rewrite the rules of the political game in a blatant attempt to overthrow the express will of the people. Stopping at nothing (the opposition uses false charges, accepts foreign assistance, uses shrill and incendiary rhetoric, refuses dialogue, and does not even stop at violating common decency by demonstrating in underwear), a collection of rude youth, power-hungry secular politicians, old regime elements, and scheming security services have conspired to declare, in effect, that Egyptians must be called to the ballot box only on condition that they reject Islamists (and if they make a mistake, they must be summoned back again).

&gt;On the other side is an equally simple story of a president who narrowly won office promising competence, inclusiveness, and conciliation but who delivered instead inflation, unemployment, power outages, fuel shortages, autocracy, sectarianism, and divisive rhetoric. Offering meaningless dialogues without the hint of concessions, his erstwhile allies have all abandoned him. And as the ranks of his critics have grown to the extent that they clearly have come to speak for the vast majority of Egyptians, the society has quite simply withdrawn confidence in him as president. Rather than following the text of a constitution that the president's party rammed through for its own purposes -- a constitution that would force the country through three more years of deterioration and despair -- Morsi should leave office now and allow the people to pick new leadership.

There are a few factors that seem to have led up to the recent protests. First, the opposition narrative, typically held by a disorganized mass that could never really get on the same page about anything consisting of leftists, labor leaders, youth movements, and the remnants of the Mubarak-era National Democratic Party, finally seems to have unified and expanded outside of its traditional base. More significantly, this narrative has become increasingly violent. Both sides increasingly see their visions for society threatened by the opposition, which is making compromise increasingly difficult. Due to all of the aforementioned issues, the military has seemed more primed than usual to intervene. In a transitional period into democratic governance, these types of events are more common than not. I think protests (though maybe not quite to this scale) will be semi-frequent over the next several years as the role of elements of society (Islam, the military, and the economy) come to take shape. It is a troubling time, for sure, but I don't believe the Egyptian experiment in democracy, even should there be a coup, be anywhere near over.",2778,5,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

Even with new leadership, they're bound by the same Constitution that Morsi's party wrote.

This combination meant that legislatures controlled, in the words of a famous governor, ""[a fucking valuable thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Blagojevich)"" but didn't much care who got the seat.  this meant they were pretty free to auction it to the highest bidder, with little worry about the consequences, and they did so.  repealing the 17th directly would just create the same dynamic, my solution wouldn't.

I agree, that second part is politics. But you neglect to talk about voting - which is also required and fairly important to re-election.

I'm happy to agree to disagree. I don't see any benefit in a lifetime appointment. The Supreme court is extremely political, and the idea that they are not seems to me to be forced. They constantly rule on and change politics in this country. It's all they do, really. They don't preside over common criminals or land disputes - they re-write law with every single decision. It does not get more political, and many times their decisions - while they are supposed to be based in law - are seemingly made for no legal reason at all.

Just my opinion.","The benefit I see is that it makes the sitting judges as apolitical as possible; as much as every appointment stirs endless talking about 'litmus tests' and whatnot, ultimately it's a position that gets filled largely on the candidate's judicial bonafides over their politics.

Isn't that the same reason that those same people turned against DOMA? That Obama in 08 was against gay marriage but in 12 was for it? Along with Clinton, most democrats, and now many Republicans? You don't think they did the same electoral math?

&gt;Any of that make any sense?

It makes sense, but that doesn't mean I agree! e_S. 
","&gt;I disagree. Instead it makes the sitting judges only concern be about how they are viewed.

How does that follow?  I don't think Roberts would've found a loophole to uphold the ACA if he'd been directly accountable to the GOP machine that put him on the bench.  I don't think Scalia's Crazy=Hannity's crazy.  Hannity is after ratings, but Scalia actually *believes* that shit. And I guarantee if you or I were locked in a room with each of them to examine the reasons for their beliefs, after an hour Hannity would be reduced to ""Just because, okay?!"", whereas Scalia would be able to go back and back and lay out a coherent reasoning for his beliefs (which I doubt I'd agree with, but still)...

&gt;I guess that is a fair point, but it sounds similar to me to the reasoning behind any aristocracy - that the people are a leviathan who do not know best... it's an old justification that always gives me the kneejerk reaction of shouting ""WRONG!"", gnome sane? So what if the people want to change constitutional law! Perhaps it needs to be changed! The current system has led the government to shoehorn any and all meanings into the existing constitution by ""judicial interpretation"" rather than by a constitutional amendment. There hasn't been a meaningful amendment in 50 years. Sounds broken to me.

We have fully political representation in the House.  If those 51% are really on the right side, the laws that come out of the house should stand up to a less political Senate and an apolitical judiciary.  If not, maybe we just need to check ourselves, you know?  Remember when we reelected Bush?  51% is a terrifyingly easy majority to achieve through manipulation and fearmongering.  This is the very *reason* amendments are so hard to pass...  changing standing law needs to be **hard**, or there is no law.

&gt;&gt;And I'm totally not advocating lifetime appointments for senators. I may have tossed that out there, but only as one extreme possibility.

Yeah, that is what happened. So we spent months and months debating a bullshit law, and hundreds of legislative hours passing it. Then had a bullshit law as law of the land for a decade, and just spend hundreds of hours of judicial time overturning and officially admitting 'yeah, that was bullshit all along, NM'.  Can't you see how wasteful that is?

This is exactly how it follows, actually. It isn't robert's job to re-write obamacare and change the ""penalty"" to a ""tax"".

It's funny that you say this. You seem to be doing quite a bit of fearmongering here. Wasn't it your intent to scare me by saying ""Remember when we reelected Bush?"" or many of the similar comments you have made in this thread about Allito and republicans in general?

&gt;This is the very reason amendments are so hard to pass... changing standing law needs to be hard, or there is no law.

I do agree with this. But hard is not impossible, as removing a lifetime appointment is. I also think that the reason amendments are rare is because no one bothers to try and do something hard when suing and hoping judges find loopholes for you is so much easier.

&gt;Can't you see how wasteful that is?

No. I see the process working as it is supposed to, actually. Difficult and prolonged disagreement doesn't mean ""waste"" to me. Just like I do not call people who disagree with me ""evil"" - they are just wrong.

&gt;Calling someone who supports redistribution a socialist, I can maybe see, but honestly in the US even that's a little more extreme..

I can't disagree enough. For some reason people who push socialist or communist ideas insist you can't call those ideas socialist or communist because it is insulting to them. But they are not insults, they are descriptions of political philosophies. The idea that a person needs to demand a full take over of the private sector in one day in order to be called a socialist or communist is, in my opinion, a semantic argument at best. And by setting some kind of arbitrary limit on the conversation like ""You can't use socialist or communist"" seems to me to not only be unfair but also stifling to conversation.

&gt;. I'm not trying to play the 'that's not what that word really means!' game, as these things are hardly set and stone and a words' use ultimately dictates its definition (I for one am a big fan of progress and individual freedom, but Progressive Liberal no longer means what it once did)...

I think ""Racist"" ""Xenophobic"" ""Homophobic"" and many more like it are used far mote cavalierly today. You seem to be towing the line with your commentary here, and I understand why to an extent. Just labeling something ""Communist"" or ""Socialist"" or ""Fascist"" without explaining why you are calling it that is an issue, I agree. But I also agree that there are many levels involved and that the terms cover a spectrum not a narrow band of behavior.

&gt;Also, where did I say I voted for Obama?

My mistake then. I thought you said you voted for him the second time. I respect a Johnson vote, as well as an Obama vote or a Romney vote.

Put a beyond a reasonable doubt standard and we know that most cases will never stand a chance because of the he-said she-said nature.

The best compromise I can see is to follow both principles; they are not necessarily contradictory. We can believe the victims and treat them as if their claims are true *and* treat claims as unproven against an accused until they are proven.

How you may ask? Well victim support does not have to go through the legal system; in fact, because of the presumption of innocence and due process, it is  horrible forum for it. We have to look at justice not as punishing the wrongdoer to achieve this; but rather justice as healing and moving forward.

Now how does this apply to the current Donald/Bill scenario? I think we should treat the victims with respect and understanding for the ordeals they have suffered. But I also think we can't take the accusations as facts against Bill or Trump without more concrete evidence. To do less would be to only pay lip service to the presumption if innocence.

There are positive/positive cases: lets say one person claims they invented something, only for another person to claim they invented the same. They both are positively motivated, with both individuals looking to gain social status or notoriety should they be proven truthful.

This trends more positive/negative. The victims in these cases already have been ushered onto the grand stage of media attention, they will likely profit in some way (not necessarily monetarily) from telling their stories, not that we should ignore the price they paid as a victim.

But meanwhile the accused will be effected negatively, on a scale we can't even measure accurately.

And the previous lawsuits had been VERY public.","The key word there is *powerful* men. When the accused man isn't powerful, the reverse is often true from what I have seen. Elevatorgate is a classic example and its inciting incident was nothing compared to the accusations against Trump or Bill Clinton. It's not the only such incident.

I think that the differentiating factor is that a powerful person's reputation can take a hit and bounce back on the strength of the other things people remember them for. They are also more able to effect a character assassination of their opponent either directly or—more commonly, in my opinion—as a side-effect of their fans' unwillingness to look at the evidence and admit that their hero could have done something awful.

As far as what happens to victims who take the stand in a trial, the fact is that testimony, even—perhaps especially—victim testimony should not be taken at face value. Memories are notoriously inaccurate and people may speak untruths without any intention of lying. This is even more the case when the situation is a traumatic or emotionally-charged one or when one's reputation is very publicly at stake. And deliberate lying isn't exactly unheard of either. So some attempt to tease the closest thing to a true account out of a witness seems extremely advisable, since courts are supposed to be about establishing truth and using that truth to render a verdict. Nonetheless, I think that courts can do a great deal more to become less traumatic, especially to victim witnesses, mostly by moving away to some degree from the adversarial system that exists now.

1) There is a big difference between saying you can do something and actually doing it.

2) It is fairly prejudicial from a legal standpoint at least to use a general statement as proof of a specific incident. Showing someone said ""I love doing drugs"" is not proof of a specific instance of doing cocaine.

3) what you are trying to pull from his statement (and pattern of behavior) is in a sense bad character evidence (the inference that he is the type of guy to do X). Legally speaking, this inference is generally more prejudicial than probative and not permitted.

4) owing to the current timing, it is very difficult to distinguish political attack from valid allegation.

5) in a sense, the witnesses/accusers have been affected by the media publication of this video and can very likely be cognitively biased; fitting their experiences to the narrative. This retroactive memory is a common issue

I think your points are fair, but if someone says to you 'I love doing cocaine' and then another friend says 'Yeah, I saw him doing cocaine once', surely the initial statement makes you far more likely to believe he's telling the truth. Yes, it's still not proven 100% and in a court system it's not proof, but for the person on the street considering whether to vote for someone if someone says he sexually assaults women and then 10 women claim he sexually assaulted them, surely it's reasonable to assume that some sexual assault did happen and that would affect your vote (potentially).

Now, it's very clear he's admitting to kissing women without consent. He then claims you can grab them by the pussy too.

He's bragging, so it's possible he's exaggerating, but it is by the plain meaning of the words an admittance.

If you choose to believe him that he was lying then, it's your decision, but it is not biased to believe he admitted to sexual assault.  If anything, it's biased to so strongly believe he admitted to nothing here and refuse to acknowledge a legitimate reading of his words.

1831,"There are two different ways Mr. Trump could be ""punished"" if these accusations are found valid.  There are punishments handed out by the government (criminal prosecution) and there are negative effects on his Presidential campaign.    Whether the government can prosecute Mr. Trump is a different question from whether public opinion can turn against him.  Public opinion has no statute of limitations, there is no burden of proof, and there are no rules about what evidence the public accepts when casting their Presidential vote.  It is up to each person to weigh the evidence themselves and react accordingly.

What would happen legally if charges are filed is a different question.  AKA whether Trump can be prosecuted by the government.  The statute of limitations on sex based crimes varies state by state.  You can find individual statutes of limitations for each state here: (https://victimsofcrime.org/docs/DNA%20Resource%20Center/sol-for-sexual-assault-check-chart---final---copy.pdf?sfvrsn=2).  

In the United States, the standard for conviction of a criminal defendant is beyond a reasonable doubt.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt#United_States).  Rules of evidence are complicated (and again vary by state to state), but the weight and value of any admitted evidnece would be the discretion of the jury to decide.

The article you cited does not relate to Trump.  The standard for sexual assaults on campus (and a school imposing sanctions) is different than someone charged criminally (and being punished by jail time).  As nicely summarized : There is a huge difference between the standard of proof required for any criminal court in the United States versus what is required in an on-campus sexual assault case. In any criminal court in the United States the standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. What that means is that the government has to prove their case in criminal court beyond any reasonable doubt.  http://criminallawdc.com/standards-for-evidence-in-dc-campus-sex-crimes-cases.html

1836,"I think the ""neutral approach"" is to look at each thing separately and on individual merit, as well as ask why the spouse of a presidential candidate doing something would be considered the same as the candidate themselves doing it. 

I don't think these are going to be prosecuted crimes - the Clinton items were never able to be prosecuted and I doubt that anything will come out that can be held against Trump legally. 

As for the libel case, there is a reason that the news papers haven't reported as many women as have come forward. In the case of the photographer who works for People, after the incident happened she requested to be pulled off of her Trump assignment. Presumably they would have that in their HR records. When you see it coming out in major publications you can bet their lawyers have already reviewed it for libel. Further I think that Trump would have to [prove their claims to be false](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/defamation-law-made-simple-29718.html). Given that, as others have mentioned, much of it comes down to he-said-she-said, its hard to prove that its false. And most of the people who have  been *published* can prove that they were with Trump at the time they are saying it occurred. 

Also, speaking neutrally, I think its odd to call Bill Clinton a ""known-philanderer"" and not Donald Trump. 

Edit: Also, per the [NYT response letter to Trump](https://twitter.com/MarkHarrisNYC/status/786620581261127680), nothing they are publishing is damaging to his character, because it is all in line with the reputation he has cultivated through his discussions with Howard Stern, and his released tape. An excerpt from their letter: 

&gt;The essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of one's reputation. Mr. Trump has bragged about his non-consensual sexual touching of women. He has bragged about intruding on beauty pageant contestants in their dressing rooms. He has acquiesced to a radio host's request to discuss Mr. Trump's own daughter as a ""piece of ass."" ...Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself.","&gt;why the spouse of a presidential candidate doing something

This is not the argument being made by ""legitimate"" Trump surrogates. Yes there are a lot of people using ""Bill Clinton's a rapist"" as an attack against Hillary (eg. just search for `bill clinton rape` on the_donald), but the actual argument being made by Trump's campaign isn't against Bill's actions it's against Hillary's reaction to what Bill (allegedly) did.  For example, from Kellyanne Conway:

&gt;But Conway said the decision to bring the four women, three of whom claim to have been the victim of rape or unwanted sexual advances by Bill Clinton, was not meant to equate Trump’s words with the Clintons’ supposed deeds. 

&gt;“Let's not conflate the two. This does not have to do with Bill Clinton. It has to do with the way Hillary Clinton shamed and blamed the women in Bill Clinton’s life,”

I find that unlikely. It's not like there's just a few women who incidentally accused Bill Clinton once or twice.

The reality is that Bill Clinton has been plagued with accusations of unusual relationships, extra martial relationships, and abusive relationships - since before he was married to Hillary. 

&gt; [source](http://nation.foxnews.com/2015/12/29/millennials-guide-bill-clintons-20-sex-scandals) - In 1974, an unnamed University of Arkansas student complained to her faculty advisor that her law professor Bill Clinton groped her and forced his hand inside her blouse. The 28-year-old law professor claimed that she was the one who came onto him.

(they were married in 1975) - there was also another incident in 1972.

Importantly, more than one of Bill's accusers have said Hillary is directly involved with threatening the accusers to remain silent. [George Stephanopoulos](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/09/hillary-clinton-treated-bill-clintons-female-accusers-lewinsky-broaddrick-flowers-hamzy-stephanopoulos/) has said this. Gennifer Flowers is really the lynchpin in the argument here - Clinton said she would ""[crucify her](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/enabler-or-family-defender-how-hillary-clinton-responded-to-husbands-accusers/2016/09/28/58dad5d4-6fb1-11e6-8533-6b0b0ded0253_story.html)"" on the stand for lying - but then, what do you know - six years later Clinton is forced to admit he did have sexual relations with that woman - he was fucking her for *12 years.* There's no way Hillary didn't know.

So, Clinton is either the single stupidest women in history - or, as many familiar with have said - she's actively involved in shielding her husband.","&gt;  Now you could argue Bill used his power of office to get Monica to do what she did.

We know Clinton had relationships with many of his accusers - there's no doubt about that - allegations of sexual assault and rape were not substantiated because there was not formal cases opened with the department of justice, and in the few cases that there was actual investigations, there was no physical evidence discovered.

IMHO all of this skirts the real question - why would Syria use chemical weapons to begin with?  These weapons are WMDs...weapons of mass destruction...it makes no sense whatsoever to use them in a limited capability when conventional weapons are just as capable of getting the job done without diplomatic fallout.  Chemical weapons enjoy many similar advantages in warfare as other forms of asymmetric warfare - [pound for pound they are cheaper to produce and far deadlier than conventional means.](https://fas.org/irp/threat/an253stc.htm)  It would make sense for small terrorist groups to utilize such weapons for maximal destruction with their minimal manpower resources, or for a government to use them to inflict large-scale human casualties over entire regions...but it makes little to no sense to use them to kill people in a school or a hospital, as little sense as using a dirty nuclear bomb to accomplish such an objective.  This makes me question whether or not Assad actually used them, or whether or not those believing Assad used them are attempting to build public opinion against Assad in order to justify a full-on military strike against his regime.

[It also bears noting that Russia and the US are the world's largest holders of chemical weapons per their declarations (sorry for the source, can't find something more official)](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-stockpile-of-chemical-weapons), so it's not that the US has some sort of moral inhibition against using them.  Rather, people should keep in mind that these weapons present asymmetric means of warfare, i.e. small commitment of resources for maximal impact, meaning that smaller governments, like in the case of nuclear weapons North Korea, can feasibly stand to far larger powers that may oppose them.  But, unless Assad has enough chemical weapons to severely hamper a US led advance and occupation into Syria and is willing to use it in that capacity, it's doubtful he actually has them or seeks to acquire them.  None of the very public accusations of Assad using chemical weapons would suggest he has this intention.

There is less investment in the carbon energy market on a global scale, and this is causing Russia to find buyers for its vast supplies of natural gas and oil. With Ukraine economically destabilized, and what appears to be a political destabilization as well (see the Russian land grab in eastern Ukraine), Russia may not come on top with a buyer for its resources. However, if turkey gains control of Syria, it's going to be an economic boon for Russia's carbon energy market, which might be able to keep them afloat to realign with the global energy trend. The motive for Russia, if not directly, then indirectly using subversion, to perform acts to destabilize the area is there.

Again, the early facts point to the fact that the chemicals were supplied by a state actor of some kind, with motive and target pointing at Assad, but could also be linked to Russia.

1.

It's safe to say that the free Syrian army has access to the same weapons that the Syrian army had based on this fact.


 &gt;I find it difficult to believe that Russia has an interest in toppling Assad. Do you have a source to corroborate such antagonism?

2. The U.S. has nothing to gain from destabilising Syria, something that still boggles my mind, the Free Syrian Army looks very similar to ISIS ideologically, something that is very risky to Israel if they somehow take control of Syria.

 &gt;I find it difficult to believe that Russia has an interest in toppling Assad. Do you have a source to corroborate such antagonism?

3.

I have no sources for this but from what I'm seeing on social media is a large amount of POTUS blaming ([source](https://twitter.com/AsaadHannaa/status/849401967625605120)) and positive messages regarding turkey by FSA operatives ([source 1](https://twitter.com/AsaadHannaa/status/849609779156848640), [source 2](https://twitter.com/AsaadHannaa/status/849610831016984576)).

I'm going to make a big claim that I can't backup, but It looks to me that Turkey might be having bigger ambitions in the middle east and western Asia.

Also, the PKK aren't active in Syria. The Kurdish fighters in Syria are the YPG (People's Protection Units). They are usually neutral in the Syrian conflict, though they sometimes cooperate with Syrian government forces e.g. the YPG collaborated with Syrian government forces when fighting against rebels in Aleppo city last year near the Kurdish suburb of Sheikh Masood. 

Assad's government are fighting a Sunni Arab insurgency, mostly composed of Islamist and jihadist rebel groups.

tl;dr You've taught me just exactly why there's almost consensus on the chemical weapons ban, but I think you go too far in thinking everyone's only in it for themselves; developed countries don't want it in the wrong hands mostly due to self-interested reasons of tactics, yet most undeveloped countries plus the UN don't want to see it because of the atrocious effect it has in war.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if the original premise behind the ban dealt with a perceived inability to defend against it, thereby rendering it a real terror on the battlefield.  A similar line of reasoning underscores nuclear non-proliferation initiatives.  

But insofar as them being uniquely brutal, IMHO that's simply not valid.  Brutality does not require technological prowess.  All it requires is an overabundance of aggression aimed at a target's weaknesses.

These are countries representing themselves in the UN, not the UN itself. Yes there are a lot of Asian allies that shun the idea of disarmament because of US influence. Their influence probably also helps enforce the chemical weapons ban. But the United Nations purposely tries to propose disarmament, such as with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. To show that they do actively support developing countries, particularly in industry as you requested I cite, just look at the stated goal of the UN's Industrial Development Organization:

""In developing countries the private sector mainly consists of micro, small and medium enterprises that generate a large share of employment and income opportunities. Often, however, their development potential remains untapped, as firms operate in isolation, are locked into uncompetitive production patterns and unable to approach dynamic business partners that could bring in new expertise and know how.

UNIDO aims to boost the development of a competitive private sector and contribute to poverty reduction by building sustainable linkages between small-size enterprises, their larger scale business partners and support institutions.

Linkages enhance enterprise competitiveness through the realization of economies of scale and scope and are a source of sustainability, as they increase the capacity of the economic actors to collectively react to crisis and turning points. Linkages also pave the way for broad-based and inclusive development, where poor entrepreneurs and workers participate in economic activities on fair terms.""



It entirely focuses on domestic industries within developing countries, and how fair practices and ""bringing in expertise"" can boost economic *competitiveness*. That means not letting bigger powers plunder smaller ones' resources like in the past, but promoting those countries growth so that they're economically competitive against larger ones. To see how them and other agencies do that, its easy to peruse the many financial development programs the UN does. They all follow under this model, not toward the benefit of highly developed countries' foreign direct investment. Their focus on environmentalism in this regard also contests the idea of pandering to constituencies, given the influential affect corporations have in such circumstances.

You had a lot of Republicans supporting military intervention, but unwilling to vote on it, basically telling the President that he can go ahead without their permission.

","I think there are actually legitimate reasons they don't use the declaration of war nowadays, and that's primarily due to the legislation itself.

Tied to the declaration of war are a vast swath of powers that were seen as fundamental, as when that legislation was edited it was during the height of the cold war and the belief that the next war was going to be WW3. Thus, due to the sheer danger of that war, powers were attached to it that gave the executive phenomenal amounts of power and authority, as it was seen that a reaction time in minutes was likely to be necessary along with the threat of nuclear attack on US territory needing quick and decisive action to mitigate it as well as in the aftermath and reclamation/recovery period.

That legislation is still the same today. And I would hope you'd agree that war with Iraq or Afganistan doesn't remotely require the breadth of powers that a WW3 with the Soviet Union would have needed.

Thus, the question is the legislation itself and why it hasn't been amended now that the threat isn't so severe. A contingency, in case it is needed thus Congress and the President developed work around?

And by the way, Obama did nothing with any of this knowledge from his alleged “spy”. And yet his FBI director went against DOJ policy to publicly reprimand Hillary and announce a reopening of Hillary’s criminal investigation a week before the election.

Remember Trump even said Comey’s public statements on Hillary were improper.

2139,"I too would like to respond to **Deleted Commenter**, but instead will just post this here:

Trump is decisively not right, as can be seen from the linked [Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/may/21/stefan-halper-fbi-informant-revelation-underscores/) article which, despite its pro-trump stance, does not say that there was a spy in Trump's campaign.

For Trump's statement to be true, three things would have to be true:

1. The informant was a ""spy,""
2. The informant was ""in the Trump campaign,"" and
3. The use of an informant in the Trump campaign undermines the ""authenticity"" or legitimacy of the special investigation.

Number 1 is easiest to substantiate, because there are a lot of different definitions of ""spy."" He was a clandestine informant, so that's probably good enough for most. ""Informant"" is definitely more apt, since he wasn't committing any crime, e.g. espionage.

Number 2 seems roundly false. There is no indication that he was in Trump's campaign in any sense.

Number 3 is subjective, but also seems nearly certain to be untrue. How would actions taken before Rosenstein or Mueller were appointed undermine their authority to investigate?

If Trump just said ""they spied on my campaign,"" it would arguably be true, but the allegations he keeps throwing around are totally unfounded.","I'd like to follow up by asking whether a court ordered warrant would be necessary for an informant to be embedded like this. If so, just like the warrant to raid Cohen, there must have been some seriously damning evidence.

2147,"&gt; Does it undermine Mueller's authority? I would think so.

I just want to point out that you're using ""authority"" here in terms of popular sentiment and not juridico-legal authority. That's not wrong, necessarily, as democratic authority issues in part from public sentiment. It's not the same, though, as juridico-legal authority. Nothing I've seen would suggest that Mueller's legal authority to conduct the investigation has in any way been compromised by this.

Note: a great deal of scholarship has gone to criticizing the degree to which public sentiment can or should influence otherwise juridical forms of political authority and decision-making in democracy. The most famous is Walter Lippmann's [Public Opinion (pdf warning)](http://wps.pearsoncustom.com/wps/media/objects/2429/2487430/pdfs/lippmann.pdf). A more recent example, though, is Achen and Bartels' [Democracy for Realists](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10671.html).

 People still talk about women making less money than men, and it has been my experience that pay rates are equal between the sexes. What about cuckoldry? Could you imagine being legally forced to pay for a child that wasn't actually yours? It happens a lot in today's society. 

I grew up in a society that told me I was to hold the door for women, pull out their chairs, and then give them equal treatment. How are chivalrous attitudes supposed to align with equality? I don't know how many feminists I have talked with that feel like men should just be shit upon, or put to death. What kind of sense does that make?

All I can say, is that I am a product of the modern feminist movement, and I am tired of being told it is not okay to be a man. I was born with a penis and also happen to be white, and apparently that just makes me wrong? I call BS.

**Edit:** Sure, some women read more books than some men, but then, some men read a lot more than some women. I appreciate what you have to say for 'traditional masculinity,' but you assume I mean ""Let's go beat those pussies up!"" You assume I come at this from a traditional male stand-point. I'm gonna clue you in, I hate sports, cars, and war. I like video games, role-playing games and I love to read books (everything from trashy adventure serials like John Carter of Mars, to The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith). By all accounts, I fit in with people born in the early 80's. 

However, I don't fit the traditional male stereotype. I don't understand why it's socially acceptable for, let's say, women to punch the shit out of me, and I'm not 'allowed' or supposed to defend myself. Seriously, what makes that okay? Is that what we're discussing? Is this my comeuppance for being born the way I was?","&gt;What do you mean by unsubstantiated claims?

I've live in Pittsburgh. It has had a declining population since the 1950's (until last year, actually) because the steel industry collapsed. Why? Without a rapidly increasing US population and urbanization, construction involving steel takes place less often and requires less material. Policies which encourage suburbanization kill urbanization, which requires exponentially more steel. Automobiles have constantly expanding lifetimes, so the auto industry needs less metal. Most importantly, international competition (in places without environmental or labor regulations) has grown constantly. It doesn't make as much sense to ship steel from Pittsburgh to Korea as it used to (but some companies in Pgh still make money doing it).

I once witnessed a trial where a boy claimed his step-mother had raped him. She spent 4 years in jail before an appeal determined that it had never happened. If he hadn't made the same sort of accusations repeatedly against other people, she would still be in jail. The effect of false accusations on the legal system has nothing to do with Misandry.

&gt;People still talk about women making less money than men, and it has been my experience that pay rates are equal between the sexes. 

In some jobs women do make less than men, regardless of experience, performance, and qualifications. In other jobs women make more than men, in the same way. For instance, restaurant servers who are the opposite sex of their patrons usually get better tips.

&gt;What about cuckoldry? Could you imagine being legally forced to pay for a child that wasn't actually yours? It happens a lot in today's society. 

Yeah, I can imagine that, especially if the child was conceiving during a relationship with the man in which the woman could reasonably assume that he would contribute to the welfare of her child. Can you imagine a woman being impregnated by a man who then cuts off all contact, moves away, or otherwises refuses to care for the child?

","More important than the list of fallacies is being able to tell what causes a fallacy to be so problematic.  While this list is convenient and easy-to-view, it does not explain what causes these fallacies to be so problematic.  Using fallacies on their own without an understanding of what causes them to be problematic is, in effect, explaining by naming (a fallacy).   So below I will explain what about fallacies is so problematic in case people reading here are not as intimately familiar with critical thinking as I have been.

All fallacies are, at their root, questionable assumptions without apparent justification that we use so regularly that we decide to name them.  Every argument (by this term, I mean ""a conclusion and the reasons leading to it"") contains crucial assumptions, but not every assumption is questionable.  For instance, if I were to argue that the Sun is hurting my eyes when I stare at it, one assumption being made is that the Sun is an object capable of causing other objects harm without directly touching those other objects.  But is it really a questionable assumption that the Sun can be an object that directly causes pain?

Some arguments do contain questionable assumptions though--in fact, most arguments do.  In economics, many economists argue that the idea market system is the competitive market.  Democratic-leaning economists (so talking U.S.) tend to argue that the government has a role in guiding markets to be more competitive and republicans typically argue that these markets work best without governments distorting them.  

Each side of the above example contains questionable assumptions about the nature of competitive markets, as well as about human nature (the behavior of which is what economics is attempting to predict).  They probably contain other assumptions which bright people (see also: smartasses) tackle on a regular basis in exhausting detail.  That's why everyone hates those guys.

Fallacies are those questionable assumptions that we make so regularly that we have created names for them.  The Ad Hoc fallacy (latin for ""and this"") is for when someone works so visibly hard to maintain a conclusion by repeatedly  explaining away the counter-evidence to that conclusion.  You can think of the Chinese lady in Dumb and dumber that keeps saying ""And then...?""  The reason why it is a fallacy is because the person explaining away each new piece of counter-evidence continues to assume that the stated conclusion and the counter-evidence (which, by definition, conflicts with the reasons and/or evidence for the conclusion) do not conflict.  There is an inherent disconnect that needs to be explained.

Hopefully, however, you'll be able to determine whether I am a questionable authority about the topic at hand.

2218,"Buckyeye's definition of ad hoc isn't as clear as it could be.   
Here's an example of ad hoc used by ""A"".

    A: ""I had cancer and I prayed for it to go away and it did. I was healed from cancer by God!""  
    B: ""Really? Why doesn't god heal others with cancer?""

If the evidence and the conclusion do not conflict, there should be reasoning for why that is the case.  For instance, suppose that some Young Earth Creationists argue that things are so complex that geological for how things became the way they are is untenable (things like ""how can you explain the complexity of a watch without assuming a [watchmaker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker_analogy)?"").  

In effect, these YECs are arguing that geologists' explanation for how the earth formed fails to explain how complex things existed because ""all complex things require an intelligent designer.""  There are several ways to point out logical missteps in that reasoning, but let's take the most respectful approach and say that the base assumption that the YECs are using is questionable.  By using the questionable assumption as the foundation for the counter-evidence, the YECs have given the pro-geology argument a free pass: ""Your counter-evidence fails to be compelling because it uses a highly questionable assumption in assuming that all things must be created by an intelligent designer when that is not necessarily the case.""

In other words, what might seem to be an ad hoc fallacy is not at all problematic because the questionable assumption is defensible (and regularly is defended).

But let's reverse the example.  Suppose we're focused on the YEC.  Someone presents the YEC with a combination of chemistry knowledge of how things work today, geological evidence using that knowledge of chemistry, and many very very old things.  The YEC explains this evidence by claiming it was all in God's plan.  A nifty catch-all, no?  More and more counter-evidence for the base claim that the world is 6,000 years old mounts, and YECs continue to explain it away by assuming their base assumption is true--which in turn explains why the counter-evidence is false.  THIS is an ad hoc fallacy in that it contains the assumption that the conclusion and the counter-evidence do not conflict.  Why don't they conflict?  Because the conclusion (god created the world 6k years ago) is true. 

Where is the justification for the assumption that the conclusion is true?  It becomes a bunch of circular reasoning.  How do we know that God did all these things?  Because it says it in the bible.  How do we know that the bible is correct?  Because God said it was correct.  How do you know that God said it was correct?  Because it say so in the bible.

I agree with you 100% that laying the blame for extremism solely on Salafis and Wahhabis is a total red herring. It's not as if they pull ideas out of thin air, and its not as if the things they do would have been out of place in 7th century Arabia.

Furthermore, there are groups who are just as conservative as Wahhabis and Salafis but receive almost no media attention whatsoever, like the [Tablighi Jamaat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablighi_Jamaat) for instance. All of these conservative sources play a role in radicalizing people, usually being the ""gateway drug"" into more extreme Jihadism.

""The response of the Saudi and Gulf rulers to Islamist radicalism in the Arab world and to the Iranian-sponsored hostile propaganda, jihad, and terrorism against them was to become more militantly pious and puritanical than their Islamic critics and adversaries (Rouleau 2002). Building on the austere Wahabism, the state religion of the House of Saud, they enforced the Islamic religious codes (the Shariah) with their religious police, following a policy of not being outflanked by an extremist Islamic religious right. In Arabic a as well as in neighboring countries, the Saudis supported and bankrolled through religious foundations fundamentalist mullahs and mosques, religious schools, social services, and charitable organizations, which, in addition to serving legitimate religious and social purposes, became a religious infrastructure for jihads and religiously motivated terrorists, including eventually against the Saudis themselves (Luttwak 2001). Nor was such mobilization unusual. In the theory of collective action (Oberschall 1995:ch.1), the surest, quickest , low-cost way of mobilizing a social, political, or religious movement is to use an already-existing infrastructure and to convert it to new uses. In their response to Iranian and Shi’ite pressure, and on top of the Iranian-sponsored religious infrastructure in the Middle East, the Saudis added and spread their variety of Islamist organization and activities. The military government of Pakistan also supported Islamist militants and their religious schools as a cheap way to promote terrorism in Kashmir and the Taliban in Afghanistan.The military government ended up creating a culture of violence that now is turned against itself (Stern 2000).

The next jihad was not against the United States but was against the Soviet army and the communist-backed government in Afghanistan. Using the model created by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards for assembling a jihad and backed by his own and Saudi money, Osama bin Laden in the 1980s established recruitment centers for Mujahedeen in the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia. Volunteers flocked to Pakistani camps where they were trained, were indoctrinated, and were readied for guerrilla combat in Afghanistan. The United States backed the Afghan resisters, including the Mujahedeen, and supplied them with sophisticated antiaircraft missiles. Bin Laden later told a journalist, ‘'To counter these atheist Russians, the Saudis chose me as their representative in Afghanistan. I settled in Pakistan in the Afghan border region. There I received volunteers from the Saudi Kingdom and from all over the Arab and Muslim countries. I set up my first camp where these volunteers were trained by Pakistani and American officers. The weapons were supplied by the Americans, the money by the Saudis’’ (Ra shid 2001:132).""

&gt;While the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) takes seriously the threat of terrorism within Saudi Arabia, it has been an ongoing challenge to persuade Saudi officials to treat terrorist financing emanating from Saudi Arabia as a strategic priority... **Still, donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.**

&gt;(S/NF) The USG engages regularly with the Saudi Government on terrorist financing... Despite this presence, however, more needs to be done since **Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, LeT, and other terrorist groups, including Hamas, which probably raise millions of dollars annually from Saudi sources**, often during Hajj and Ramadan. In contrast to its increasingly aggressive efforts to disrupt al-Qa'ida's access to funding from Saudi sources, Riyadh has taken only limited action to disrupt fundraising for the UN 1267-listed Taliban and LeT-groups that are also aligned with al-Qa'ida and focused on undermining stability in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Those two men may have provided financial, legal and social help to two of the hijackers in San Diego.

&gt;Additionally, the FBI discovered that numbers in the phone book of **al Qaeda lieutenant Abu Zubaydah traced back to an umbrella company used to manage the Colorado residence of the then-Saudi ambassador, Prince Bandar bin Sultan**

&gt; but I can't ignore the fact that FISA has almost never denied a single query request made by the NSA

I want to know the standards they go by as well, but the fact that none have been denied might be due to the NSA knowing exactly what they need to have before hand. They may only be going for sure bet warrents, but without further information its all speculation sadly.

&gt; I see literally no reason as to why the information they disclosed to the public had to be classified.

Not the best reason, but now that this information is out, the people the NSA may be targeting are aware of it they may be more cautious with their communications from here own out. That making them harder to track and therefore stop from plotting bad stuff is probably the NSA's logic here. ","[Here is a direct quote from the CNN article printed today](http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/18/technology/yahoo-prism/index.html?hpt=hp_t2)

&gt;Microsoft received between 6,000 and 7,000 criminal and security warrants, subpoenas and orders affecting as many as 32,000 customer accounts.

You're going to have a hard time convincing me that every single one of those warrants are legitimate. Other stats show Apple receiving 5,000 requests, Facebook receiving around 9,000 to 10,000, and Yahoo! receiving around 12,000. These stats are merely over the last 6 months. 

As for your comment of terrorists knowing the NSA's methods, I still think the public has a right to know about this, because not knowing about this really does set up a Big Brother type of world. Now, after hearing the other side of the story (the NSA's and the FBI's) we know that it's not as bad as we thought it was because of the massive amounts of oversight, but does the American public not have a right to know how they are being protected? I just think not telling us puts far too much power in the hands of the government, and they need to learn this ""Trust us, we know what we are doing"" mentality is not acceptable.

Depends on what you mean by legitimate. Each one of them may comply with the current laws. That's the problem with alot of this stuff, it's not wrong because it is illegal. The problem in my view is many of the current laws are either too broad or easily interpreted in ways the vast majority of people would disagree with.

&gt; I still think the public has a right to know about this, because not knowing about this really does set up a Big Brother type of world.

Well, technically, knowing about it is what makes it more big brother, since the purpose of Big Brother was to let everyone know they are being watched and make them paranoid. Not really arguing with you hear, just pointing that out.

&gt; I just think not telling us puts far too much power in the hands of the government, and they need to learn this ""Trust us, we know what we are doing"" mentality is not acceptable. 

I agree, the public should know, I was just stating the possible NSA logic behind it. But it is a hard problem. We want the government to give us security but have vastly different ideas about how. They think they have the right amount of oversight, but that's debatable.

However, I agree with you to a large extent, this psychology quirk can not be counted on in the long run. All that said, eventually this will fall apart. In time people will adapt to the status quo.

","1. Being the big fish in a trade agreement has geopolitical advantages. Instead of threatening countries with costly military action, you can just use sanctions.

Warfare is (and is becoming) much less explicit than in the past. It's about plausible deniability and economic warfare at this point.

2. Building on point 1, this also strengthens the cooperation between countries. China and the US are basically competing to add people to their economic coalitions. Since China is a big country, the only way to offset that power (assuming you even feel the need to offset that power is necessary) is to build a coalition of smaller countries. Up until recently these smaller countries like Vietnam, Korea, Japan, Phillipines, etc. were all fighting each other which made it easier for China to divide and conquer.

3. Chinese labor costs are rising quick, and Western countries need more sources of cheap labor. Trade and development deals can provide this cheap labor. And when those countries are developed in a few decades, the focus will shift to Africa. There is never an end to this until the whole world is developed.

4. This will be bad for many low to mid level US workers because more industries and businesses will move some operations overseas (or not move them back since Chinese labor costs are up). At first, just the manufacturing is moved and US companies have to babysit these factories to make sure the quality and logistics are there. Later, the factories become more self-sufficient and start to reproduce existing Western products on their own accord, which they then sell to Western companies. Western companies like this because the risk and investment is less for them.

5. Costs will decrease or at least not increase as much as they otherwise would have, and there will eventually be more competition and interesting products on the market.

~~Banks and corporations are not evil - they are simply legal constructions. People who exploit others to the extent that they have IS indeed evil, but just about any measure...except the morals of the people doing the exploiting and their supporters.~~

Let's leave ""evil"" and ""morals"" aside here.

My own personal thinking on this is that this has been primarily a tax policy problem.

We've used the power of the State Department to negotiate these trade treaties and the corporations have profited handsomely, but when they try to bring back their profits they realize that they are required to pay a high tax rate (the quid pro quo). So they willingly forget that they owe Americans those tax dollars, and claim that their huge profits overseas are due to their own entrepreneurial genius. 

So now you have trillions of dollars in corporate profits hiding overseas that should be redistributed amongst Americans, especially Americans that lost their jobs because of globalization, but that isn't happening. If it did, all Americans would benefit from those trade deals.

The problem, then, isn't the economic ideas behind global trade deals, it's the politics of their implementation. Congress has to demand corporations pay their taxes but one Party thinks all taxes are bad, so they can't in good conscience do that. ",(pass),11756,78,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

2418,"From Kevin Carson's [At Reason, War is Peace … and TPP is “Free Trade”](https://c4ss.org/content/41012):

&gt; . . . such agreements are the direct opposite of free trade. They create a net increase in protectionism. The reduction of tariffs and other barriers to the movement of goods across national borders is only secondary, if not incidental. Their purpose, rather, is to drastically increase the form of protectionism most central to the dominant corporate business model today: So-called “intellectual property.” The draconian IP provisions of contemporary “free trade” treaties serve the interests of global corporations the same way high industrial tariffs served American corporations a century ago.

&gt; . . .

&gt; These treaties, by facilitating the movement of means of production across borders, enable corporations to contract production to independent sweatshops in low wage countries, pay them $2 for a pair of sneakers, and import them for sale at Walmart for $200. And because patents and trademarks give them a monopoly on sale of the product, they’re protected against the independent contractors deciding to produce identical shoes and selling them for $10 on the local market.

&gt; In the early 20th century, when most industrial capital was national, Western countries’ main imports were raw materials from the colonial world and their main exports were finished industrial goods. So it was in the interest of American manufacturers to restrict competition in the domestic market from imported goods manufactured in other industrialized countries. Fast forward 100 years though, and most American imports are by the Western-owned global corporations themselves, importing goods produced under contract for them so they can sell them in the domestic market at an enormous “intellectual property” markup over the cost of production.

&gt; Since the movement of goods across borders is now mostly an internal affair of global corporations themselves, outmoded tariffs that impede the movement of goods have become an inconvenience. What they need, instead, is a form of protectionism that still gives them a monopoly over selling a particular product in a particular market — but operates at corporate boundaries rather than national ones. That’s what “intellectual property” does.

&gt; . . .

&gt; So what’s falsely called “free trade” today isn’t a decrease in protectionism. It’s a shift from one kind of protectionism that no longer serves corporate interests, to a new kind of protectionism that better serves them.",Thanks,11756,83,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

2430,"The question about Trump's spending is pretty clearly tied to government activity.  It's asking how much money the government is spending on something.  And questions about government activity are properly classified as political.

There are many climate related questions which could be political questions.  For instance:

* Is a carbon tax an effective tool for fighting climate change?

* What sort of treaty protocols could enforce global agreements on emissions?

* What regulations have been particularly effective or ineffective relating to climate change?

* Is the US government's stance on climate change scientifically justified?

The thing of those examples is that they directly tie climate change to particular government action of some sort, which makes them political questions.  

Your question is purely asking about scientific consensus, with really no tie to government or policy.

There are also some other rules your post breaks in as much as it tries to exclude certain answers or paths of discussion, which violates our rules around neutral framing.  But those could be fixed.  The reason I gave it the rejection reason I did was that the issue of not being a political question did not seem fixable while still asking the question you wanted to ask.","Hmm... Ok, what about the following (I have removed my citations for this draft) : 

Title: Is the US government's stance on climate change scientifically justified?

The right has been categorized for some time as totally denying climate change. However, there are arguments that recognize human-generated rising CO2 levels, their greenhouse effect, and the fact that this has led to increases in global temperatures, but also state that even if unchecked, we have little reason to believe that this poses a serious or even mild threat. This argument has existed in the 'alt right', if you will, as far back as 2009.

On the other hand, Obama famously remarked that 97% of climate scientists agree in human-made global warming, a claim that, though debated, seems well supported based on some quick googling 12. It also seems to me like a relatively uncontroversial claim. However, in demonstrating that this is a call to action, his implication is that these same climate scientists believe that this warming will continue, and that this will pose a serious environmental problems, an idea that is challenged by some more-reasonable conservative sources 34. I am therefore curious if 97%...or some high percentage of climate scientists would agree that there is reasonable certainty that unchecked global warming is a grave environmental threat in the near term (&lt;50-100 years)? That is, is there indeed scientific justification for major climate action?? Does anyone have a sense on what the field thinks with respect to the confidence that we can assign to the predictions of climate models, what these climate models suggest in the aggregate, and how well they have performed thus far?

Additionally, in science I recognize that there are biases that can encourage cherry-picking data, or shaping papers in particular ways, or, in extreme circumstances, forging or explicitly lying about observations or conclusions. These biases clearly exist, and are championed by the right as examples of a systematic global manipulation i the field of climate science to push a narrative of catastrophe. On the other hand, people in climate science have devoted their lives to understanding these phenomena, are uniquely qualified to offer opinions on future projections, and to imagine they are systematically politically persuaded on a global scale to lie for political or funding purposes seems hyperbolic.  (It might be of interest to note the recent high-profile science paper's climate data controversey ).

So does anyone have any insight? Anyone worked for a substantial amount of time in climate science to be able to personally vouch for confidence (or lack thereof) in our climate models in predicting trends accurately, and hence in the left's agenda for climate action justified? Or if other mechanisms like carbon sequestration may render a saturation of CO2 levels in the near-term? (this is the only mechanism I can come up with off the top of my head that might be reasonable explanation for global warming not meaningfully continuing, but I assume other's know way more about this than I). And perhaps more importantly, is there any good reason why the scientific justification is not articulated in a very public way to the point where this shouldn't really be a discussion?

2436,"Overt discrimination based on citizenship is socially condoned and legal enshrined.

The foreign aids and military interventions of most developed countries towards other countries reflect a belief that a citizen's life is more important than the lives of a large number of noncitizens. Similarly, the immigration and trade policies reflect a view that a small increase in the standard of living of a citizen is more important than a much larger increase for a noncitizen.

Why is thinking and acting like this acceptable with regard to the country one was born in, but totally unacceptable with regards to, say, race? 

To my eye, US law discriminates against Mexican nationals in a similar manner to how apartheid South Africa discriminated against non-whites.  For the most part, it prevents them from working in the US, denies them the right to vote in the US and deports those that do come. Those deported are sent back to an area where they have lower quality health care, schools, employment opportunities, et cetera. We have segregation in that we force one group to live in a completely different country.

Many of the justifications for these restrictions are also similar. If US law didn't discriminate against Mexican nationals, millions would migrate. This would change the social structure of the US, perhaps cause an increase in crime, and probably decrease wages for low-skill American workers.

What am I missing? Why is discriminating based on citizenship acceptable as a world view and as government policy?

(To be clear, this isn't meant to justify apartheid or racism but rather to question nationalism.)

*EDIT1* 

I've replied to a bunch of posts. My replies were intended to be provacative and spark discussion. I've seen posts I agree with, but I have only seen a couple of posts that defend US immigration policy in a way that couldn't be rationally used to defend apartheid.

Thanks everyone for the great responses. I'm sorry I haven't been able to reply. I'm currently in a country where the average income is less than a dollar a day and internet access is correspondingly spotty.

Even if I donated half my income, an additional dollar to me would still matter so much less than an additional dollar would help the worlds poor.

I think what you may be getting at is the notion that the number of jobs is highly *elastic*. By that I mean, the number of jobs is very responsive to changes in other factors like consumer demand.

That being said, cdb03b has a point if you remove the word ""jobs"" from the conversation and replace it with ""resources"". Every nation has limited resources to support the growth of its citizens. These resources in turn derive from the fractional effort of a great many of these citizens. If the ratio of citizens to non-citizens becomes too great, with citizens alone paying into the nation's redistributive mechanisms (taxes and services, essentially), then citizens can become angered by the imbalance this process creates. 

Essentially, citizens pay more into the support system a nation offers (protection from threats, subsidized food and medical treatment, innovation in science and technology, etc.) than non-citizens. These protections are, in part, offered to those who live within the boundaries of the nation in question, regardless of citizenship. Thus, citizens are angered by the presence of a large number of non-citizens.

&gt;Why is discriminating based on citizenship acceptable as a world view and as government policy?

Here is the question being asked. It asks why we find it *socially* acceptable. He didn't ask you to restate the situation, which is all you did. 

&gt;The fact that it is not discrimination but a nation enforcing it's laws and protecting the stability and economy of it's citizenry negates that portion of the OP's question. 

I don't think you really get what is being asked. A nation, by enforcing its laws, can discriminate. That is what Jim Crow was. There is no negation. Simply because a nation does a thing that is legal by its own laws does not make it socially, morally, otherwise acceptable. Please, please, think a bit more critically here. 

&gt;It is not the job of the US to provide housing, food, healthcare, defense, legal justice, jobs, or anything for non-citizens. 

Legally yes, but *this is no way answers the question being asked*. You massively have failed at critical reading here. Simply because it is not the US's job legally does not mean it isn't discrimination, isn't unfair, and isn't immoral.

There are basically 3 tracks for immigration. The first is refugees and it is the one that actually tend to be the largest in recent years, the second is skilled labor (doctors, scientists, engineers, etc), and the third is unskilled labor (manual labor, janitors, etc). There are a limited number of slots given for each of these and once they are filled no more can immigrate that year. This is because we as a nation have a finite number of jobs and resources with which to care for our existing citizenry and in order to do it's job of protecting that citizenry they must limit how many new immigrants are competing for the resources.

2483,"First and foremost, ""We need to look out for our own"" was never in my post. What I said was that the function of a government is to provide for the cohesion and safety of their citizenry. That is simply the function of the institution. You can argue about what the true goals are of a government, whether they be safety and cohesion, economic stimulation, projectors of power and force, etc. but in the end, the function of governments is to govern their citizens.

Secondly, my post wasn't about race, and to try and make an outright substitution of one issue for another is not genuine to the intent of my post. In the case of race, a person holds their racial identity regardless of their actions. This fact is what makes racism so repugnant, and legislated racism even more repugnant, as the function of governments and their legislatures is to promote the cohesion and safety of their people. Citizenship, on the other hand, is absolutely mutable. As I've said earlier, there are legal channels to acquire new citizenship. There are not ANY channels to change one's race. In this way, citizenship is not an entirely arbitrary classification. Remember, if you were born in the country, then your parents paid taxes into the government that has granted you citizenship, you were raised under the government's education standards, and since your first working day, taxes on your labor have gone back into the government that granted you citizen for the ""arbitrary"" reason that you were born into the society that is governed by that government.

Thirdly, there is no public place in America that non-citizens aren't allowed. Foreign tourists are not restricted in their movements in the slightest. For the type of discrimination that you propose to exist, these tourists would be equally disadvantaged, wouldn't they? 

Finally, the extension of your argument is that governments should treat all human beings as equal, including with regard to the rights they reserve and protect for their citizens. This begs the great question, what about war? Before you go arguing that in an ideal world there is no war, I'm sure that we can all agree we live in a non-ideal world, and war is not likely to disappear within any of our lifetimes. So does this ideal government that grants all humans equal rights under their governing document (e.g. The Constitution of the United States) simply bow out of fighting wars? Do they turn the other cheek and hope they can weather the assault or do they declare it legal to murder some humans (who in this case are supposed to be afforded all constitutional protections) as long as the government deems them enemies? 

Even in peacetime, does the government that you're speaking of, with no ability to collect revenue from a global population, insure that the services they offer to their sub-poverty line citizens are offered to all sub-poverty line citizens? How long can even the wealthiest of nations keep something like this up? Do you see how trying to apply an egalitarian across all lines metric to a government's actions is much too idealistic to try and apply wholesale?

Trying to make my post into something racist by substituting ""race"" for ""citizenry"" and referencing the apartheid is theatrical. If after reading this, you feel that my argument really *is* analogous to race, despite the points I've raised, I'd love to hear your justification, but I honestly think that mutable and immutable traits are not fair analogues. The fact of the matter is, there are Hispanic Americans at all levels of the socioeconomic ladder, including the top. This is a situation that did NOT exist for non-whites in apartheid Africa. Some of those Hispanic Americans were foreign nationals at one point, and through the same legal channels available to everybody (which in order to be able to vote includes education over the governmental system of America, the history of America, and the voting system of America for instance) gained the rights protected for Americans by the American government (with questionable success and sincerity) that Americans pay for. Personally, I believe that there is some value to providing incentive for people to pursue legal channels to immigrate into a country because of the predictability they provide in terms of population growth and the control valves that they provide for the government of a nation to help ensure the quality of life (via employment and public resource management) that their nation seeks.","Countries are basically groups consisting of specific people.

I want to follow up on this point, as I think it illustrates a general fallacy in preventing bad behavior. 

Let's say that Action X is considered ""bad"" in our country. Joe Schmo comes from a culture where Action X is tolerated, perhaps even encouraged. Citizen **scashman** says, ""I hate Action X, and I don't want people who tolerate Action X to be admitted to this country.""

Of the two options -- allowing Joe Schmo to immigrate, or preventing Joe Schmo from immigrating, which option is likely to result in *less incidence of Action X*?

I argue that allowing immigration will reduce the frequency of Action X. Going from a culture that tolerates or encourages Action X, to one that does not, will put negative peer pressure on Joe to change his ways. Indeed, we may have more incidents of Action X within our borders, but the absolute total frequency of Action X among all potential actors is certain to go down.

Non-citizens are allowed everywhere on the planet except the one country, where only citizens and people following the laws for immigration/tourism are allowed.

Ending slavery didn't end racism. So does that mean ending slavery was a mistake? If it was easier to come to the US, more people would and the sum of human happiness would increase. Sending money to ones family is extremely common among immigrants so it seems likely that the countries who sent the immigrants would also do better, not just the immigrants themselves. Many Americans would also do better, although a number would likely do worse.

It really depends on just what you are doing to discriminate. Under the South African government, non-whites had their land seized, were prevented from voting, and were generally shit upon in every way possible. But non-citizens are not treated this way: I can buy land in another country, no problem. I can drive across most borders just by waving a passport.

Many people have already gone over why citizenship is a fair way to discriminate. The taxes, the responsibilities, the resources, etc etc. They carry the load, they get the big share of the benefits. Race doesn't apply to these things: No one race does more work than another, or has more responsibilities than another. They just aren't the same.

You can also switch citizenship (it may not be easy, but it is quite possible and happens on a daily basis). You can't do this with race.

Do you think it is unethical to deny something to a complete stranger that you would give to a close friend or family member?

&gt;I'm hoping some US history buffs can weigh in on this. Is the legacy of America the fact that intellectuals were finally afforded a chance to start from scratch and write a proper constitution? 

America was largely influenced by [Natural Rights](http://www.law.columbia.edu/hamburger?exclusive=filemgr.download&amp;file_id=942328&amp;rtcontentdisposition=filename%3DNatural) although there [were a few different ideas on how to implement it](http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles2/contmodels.htm) the two main parties were the Federalist  and Anti-Federalists

[The Federalists](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/duel/peopleevents/pande05.html) were mainly identified with James Madison, John Jay and Alexander Hamilton these three men wrote [*The Federalist Papers*](http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fedpapers.html).  The Federalists argued for a stronger central government, and a fiscally sound government (strong central bank).  This was largely a party of businessmen.

[The Anti-Federalists](http://www.ushistory.org/us/16b.asp) also called The Democratic-Republican Party consisted of Patrick Henry and George Mason and Thomas Jefferson, who strongly opposed Hamilton's ideas (if you thought bad politics was a new thing in the US...it isn't).  They were afraid of the power of a central government and were primarily made up of independent frontiersmen.  

But most people were not completely for the Revolution it was groups like [the Sons of Liberty](http://www.masshist.org/revolution/sons_of_liberty.php) that really rallied people to the cause.  

&gt;Or, is America just the best case of a free market with good competition and informed consumers? Did we just get lucky by discovering a gigantic plot of land that was relatively easy to claim? What has been the dominating factor?

Maybe I put the 'or' in a bad spot. My intention was just to list a couple possible factors that people could potentially consider the dominant forces in the US's development. I didn't mean to couple those two items in the list together. 

Forgetting for a moment how the constitution came to be, has it really been the guiding force in our country's development? Or are there external factors that could have helped the nation succeed regardless of the natural rights that we reserved in the Constitution?

&gt;“Our strategy is working,” said Army Colonel Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, who denied that Iraqi forces fled their positions as they did last year in the face of an Islamic State blitzkrieg in northern Iraq. The Islamic State “forces simply had the upper hand, and it was time for Iraqi forces to reposition,” he said.

&gt;“The president’s plan isn’t working,” Boehner told reporters. “It’s time for him to come up with a real, overarching strategy to defeat the ongoing terrorist threat.”

&gt;“This is a major setback, both for the Iraqi government and the U.S.,” retired Army General David Barno, the former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said of Ramadi’s capture. “It calls into question whether the Iraqi security forces can fight effectively.”

President Obama has stated that his goal in batteling ISIS is that ""[“We Will Degrade and Ultimately Destroy ISIL”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/10/president-obama-we-will-degrade-and-ultimately-destroy-isil)

&gt;The President reiterated that as Commander-in-Chief, his “highest priority is the security of the American people,” and noted that we have “consistently taken the fight to terrorists” that threaten the United States:

ISIS or ISIL or IS - depending on your desired nomenclature - invaded Iraq from Syria in 2014 after 3-4 years of gearing up. It seems to me that the Obama Administration's strategy on how to deal with ISIS has not changed in the last year and a half. What is the strategy? How will it result in the ""destruction"" of ISIS. During the Bush administration, it seemed very important for there to be benchmarks set to mark progress. Have benchmarks been set by the President or anyone else in the government? How well are those benchmarks being met?

I don't believe anyone wants ISIS to thrive and grow. However, the way in which we stop ISIS seems to me to have no consensus or clear outline of goals, or a way to achieve them. I'd love to hear from people who disagree and can outline the strategy for me.

EDIT: As a follow up question - Will the Obama administration be passing the presidency with the middle east (Syria, Iraq, Libya) looking the way it does today?

However, it seems to me like the bigger imperative is to simply not get involved, for better or worse. I do think there is something to the idea of letting ISIS spin itself out: them trying to actually be a state in any long term sense of the word seems to be unfeasible. But I think that attitude is very convenient explanation for simply not wanting to do it.

I will admit that is speculation, so I would be open to hearing alternate theories.

But assuming that is perhaps the case, I would imagine that the reason to not do it is because it isn't really clear what a good strategy would be. I haven't heard a detailed plan of what he should be doing that includes an exit strategy and end game.

There seems to be polls suggesting a rise in support for boots on the ground:

Perhaps we'll see a shift in the strategy go from an (unofficial) nothing to a conditional ""something"" as the polls change. That could make sense: people didn't want to do it, but now they do. So we weren't doing something, but now we will.

I'm not sure why you don't see it. You said they want them gone, are taking steps to make them go away, but don't want to be involved...

Now I agree with your assessment - they want them gone up to a point. They are willing to go so far to help ISIS get destroyed - but they won't go any further than that. This isn't a ""We will win at any cost"" situation. It is a ""I hope we can win if we make this bombing effort, but we aren't doing anything else.""

That is extremely contradictory.

&gt;The President has laid out his strategy;

I thought you just said he didn't have one - and that no one had one?

I agree with your summary of his strategy. It's part of that ""We will only go so far"" theory.

&gt;I just haven't heard anything that sounds comprehensive without basically boiling down to, ""Just go there and stay"" without any kind of timetable for withdrawal (or explicit mention that we should be a permanent occupying force).

I posed the very same questions about the President's strategy in this thread. What is the time table for the bombing runs that we started oin ISIS back in 2014? When will these end? What is a metric for success? Clearly losing Rahmadi and having ISIS go door-to-door executing anyone in the Iraqi government isn't a good benchmark...

&gt;Yeesh.

Yeah. That's exactly how I feel about this too.

&gt;Maybe we can go into the weeds on it in a technical manner in it's own submission or something.

I did... maybe a year or more ago:

http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1lt6db/president_bush_acted_more_responsibly_in_iraq_and/","&gt; It is a ""I hope we can win if we make this bombing effort, but we aren't doing anything else.""

Right. Threading the needle between not trying to get overly involved while also achieving a secondary objective of aiding in the fall of ISIS. Not sure what is contradictory about that.

&gt; I thought you just said he didn't have one - and that no one had one?

I didn't say he didn't have a strategy. I said the administration doesn't want to be involved. Specifically, ""overly involved"". As you said, ""We will only go so far"". Limited force can be a strategy, especially in the larger view of strategy in the region.

What is being presented is a limited set of actions that balances not getting into another Iraq quagmire (even if you think that is an unfair assessment, surely you can imagine that is the mindset that is driving this approach) while also helping against extremists. So again, this has been presented. I'm not really clear on how it is his job to also provide a competing strategy to the one he presented. If he thought there was a better, different plan, he'd be executing/promoting it.

&gt; What is the time table for the bombing runs that we started oin ISIS back in 2014? When will these end? What is a metric for success?

This is a good point, and I think leads to my ultimate thoughts on the subject. I haven't seen a timetable or metric for success besides simple target elimination stats.

However, this isn't a bug its a feature, as they say. The real metric of success is working with the Iraqis and providing support to them. We are doing that. Putting boots on the ground puts way more of an imperative on us to provide details of objectives and timelines because we become a foreign occupying force and put many more of our troops in danger.

And simply, with air operations- we leave when we want to. If it isn't working, we can leave. If we hit some arbitrary goal, we fly away. Boots on the ground become more of an occupation, nation building, mission creep, vague operation. And the larger the force, the more this seems to be the case. This doesn't seem to be inherent to air vs. ground military operations, per se. But certainly seems to be the practical habits of these kinds of operations.

I suppose you could in theory propose some ""surge"" level operation that lasts 6 months explicitly, and try to avoid the occupation baggage. But that has its own problems, as well. And I'm not seeing anyone laying that out, so far.

&gt; Clearly losing Rahmadi and having ISIS go door-to-door executing anyone in the Iraqi government isn't a good benchmark...

As opposed to what? Sending in ""all the troops"" and sitting on Iraq until everyone plays nice? Again- for how long? What local leaders help without exacerbating Sunni vs. Shiite tensions? How do we know that things wont devolve yet again when we leave?

This is what I think is the elephant in the room that I haven't seem anyone at a high level seriously address: there are no good options. Even if you think the Iraq invasion was great or whatever... many, many people don't. When I talk about the ""official"" strategy vs. the implicit one is essentially what people have been pointing out for a long time: why can't the middle east take care of their own trash? We can help them, in appropriate ways and times. But trying to setup a new American state in the middle east by force just won't work. It seems that the only thing Sunni and Shia extremists *can* agree on is that they hate America and don't want us in the middle east.

They don't want us there and there isn't a clear path for America imposing peace upon the region by force. Its just that the American people can't handle that reality, so the government has to talk about ""targeted bombings"" to counterbalance what I feel is the larger strategy of limited engagement.",10253,27,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

I guess we will have to agree to disagree.

&gt;Limited force can be a strategy, especially in the larger view of strategy in the region.

Sure, not really trying but kind of trying is a strategy many people employ.

&gt;This is a good point, and I think leads to my ultimate thoughts on the subject. I haven't seen a timetable or metric for success besides simple target elimination stats.
&gt;However, this isn't a bug its a feature, as they say.

It's interesting you feel that way. Did you feel that way about the Bush Administration, or did you feel they needed time tables?

&gt;The real metric of success is working with the Iraqis and providing support to them. We are doing that.

Most reports say we are not doing that. Iran is.

&gt;Iran-backed Shiite militias mobilize to retake Iraq's Ramadi

You write:

&gt;Boots on the ground become more of an occupation, nation building, mission creep, vague operation.

And again, I am happy to disagree with you. This is a very clear mission. The vague mission is ""We want to destroy ISIS, we will bomb them, sometimes, and we promise not to ever put boots on the ground... But we will ""follow them to the gates of hell"" as the VP said.

&gt;As opposed to what? Sending in ""all the troops"" and sitting on Iraq until everyone plays nice? Again- for how long? 

Well, if we took action in 2011 when ISIS was becoming a threat rather than make fun of them and call them the JV team - it wouldn't be to this point. But yes - the only way to ""Destroy ISIS"" is to go destroy them. If we decide they are not really our enemy and they can build a base in Syria to train and arm and plan, then we shouldn't be suprised when 30,000 of the regions most battlehardened troops invade Iraq with some success.

Is the road harder now because of the last 6 years of foreign policy? You bet.

When does it end? It ends when ISIS no longer has safe havens to recruit and rearm and plot their attacks.

&gt;Even if you think the Iraq invasion was great or whatever

War isn't great. Anyone who has the perception that it is has never been anywhere near it. People shouldn't like it. But they shouldn't like what has been happening for the last 4+ years even more.

Do you know that the US bombed Libya for 10 months in 2011 until the government was destroyed? Or do you think we had nothing to do with that?

&gt;They don't want us there

The Iraqi government began begging for help the minute ISIS invaded.","&gt; Sure, not really trying but kind of trying is a strategy many people employ.

Limited, specific scope doesn't automatically equal not trying.

&gt; It's interesting you feel that way. Did you feel that way about the Bush Administration, or did you feel they needed time tables?

I felt they needed time tables, as I stated. Later on in my comment I explain how boots on the ground with a large force is different.

&gt; Most reports say we are not doing that. Iran is.

We are *both* doing that. Again, showing the Sunni vs. Shiite dynamics at play.

&gt; And again, I am happy to disagree with you. This is a very clear mission.

What was clear about the goals of the Iraq occupation? What was the win condition that allowed us to leave? The fall of Saddam's regime? Getting greeted as liberators and leaving before the year is out? Finding the weapons of mass destruction? Finding Saddam? Killing Saddam? Having a democratic election? The surge?

Consistently offering logistics and air support to friendly government forces for an extended period of time in conjunction with not giving up on effective global counter-terrorist operations for the long term is a plan. Seems consistent to me. It's just not sending thousands upon thousands of our soldiers to run a foreign country. You can not like it. You can not like the specifics. But that doesn't mean it's contradictory or unclear.

&gt; Well, if we took action in 2011 when ISIS was becoming a threat rather than make fun of them and call them the JV team - it wouldn't be to this point.

And when ISIS came in, would our presence have made any difference to the local population that sided with them? Would American troops being there have made them suddenly not dislike the Shiite government and want to completely fold automatically because they liked Sunni authoritarians better than Shiite ones?

They *were* the JV team. The problem is that parts of the population *liked* them.

&gt; Do you know that the US bombed Libya for 10 months in 2011 until the government was destroyed? Or do you think we had nothing to do with that?

Yes, I do. We didn't occupy it like we did Iraq, however. Not sure what you're getting at, there.

&gt; The Iraqi government began begging for help the minute ISIS invaded.

And then I listen to news reports saying that the people are in hiding because they don't trust ISIS *or* the government. Of course the government wants help- they are Shiite.

Limited, specific scope doesn't automatically equal not trying.

&gt; It's interesting you feel that way. Did you feel that way about the Bush Administration, or did you feel they needed time tables?

I felt they needed time tables, as I stated. Later on in my comment I explain how boots on the ground with a large force is different.

&gt; Most reports say we are not doing that. Iran is.

We are *both* doing that. Again, showing the Sunni vs. Shiite dynamics at play.

...again, I will repeat that I have addressed why I think specifics for timelines and exit strategies are more important for boots on the ground as opposed to air campaigns.

 &gt; You keep saying the Obama administration has a strategy and that it is ""To destroy ISIS""

No, they have a strategy to help others destroy ISIS.

&gt; I feel it is contradictory to say ""I will do whatever it takes to defeat ISIS - Except use our military on the ground""... and you don't see any contradiction there.

Huh? How about, ""I will do whatever it takes to defeat ISIS, except I won't hit the country of Iraq with nuclear weapons."" Is it still *wildly* inconsistent? Are we supposed to heckle at the press conference, ""But you said *whatever it takes!*""

&gt; Is restoring order more difficult than just bombing from the air? You bet. But the long term results of restoring order are far better than the years of just bombing from the air.

If you actually think of a plan as to how that will work. The Bush administrations implementation of De-Baathification and some quotes I'll provide below are just a taste of the wishful thinking an pure naivety displayed by their 'plan' for invasion.

&gt; &gt; Getting greeted as liberators and leaving before the year is out?

&gt; Huh? Are you talking about Libya? Because that was never a goal in Iraq.

These quotes don't make me think of a plan for long term restoration of order.

&gt; &gt; Finding Saddam? Killing Saddam? Having a democratic election? The surge?

&gt; Well, Killing Saddam was up to the Iraqis... but those were all goals as well. Yes.

And yet no announcement of a pullout when those things were either achieved, or in the case of WMDs, found not to exist. So again- mission creep. We achieved our goals and... just kinda stayed.

&gt; relative peace that Obama inherited when he took office in 2009.

Man, where do I begin.

First, withdrawal began in 2007. and, ""in 2008 George W. Bush signed the U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement. It included a deadline of 31 December 2011, before which ""all the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory"". The last U.S. troops left Iraq on 18 December 2011, in accordance with this agreement. US Forces ultimately returned to Iraq in June 2014.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_U.S._troops_from_Iraq

In fact, Obama actually wound up *extending* the length of the troop stay longer than what Bush wrote. You should probably just read the whole wiki to review. Case in point, the inference that Obama abruptly pulled the plug right before we were going to ""win"" is simply not supported by facts.

But secondly, in an more abstract view... in your own words you describe, ""the relative peace that Obama inherited when he took office in 2009"". Saddam and his regime dead and gone, no weapons of mass destruction, democratic elections, and now in your own words: ""relative peace"". Ok, so there was peace. So... why were we staying again?

&gt; The mistake was not taking out ISIS in Syria before they grew large enough to invade.

Man, between this and what I think you are implying about Libya, you have some pretty grand plans for attacking, invading and occupying the middle east. This could spin off into it's own conversation.

&gt;You use trained and accountable militaries (we happen to have the finest on earth) and you attack the enemy in their safe havens until they have none.

Attacking their safe havens until ""they have none"" (100% completion) means attacking, destroying, collaterally-damaging, and occupying the populace you are trying to win over. Also, as these areas are Sunni, you are implicitly helping Iran.

&gt; You don't hand out weapons to unacountable militias that then sell them to ISIS.

So much for ""gaining the support of tribal leaders"". Looks like we're doing this one alone.

&gt; You don't just bomb the place from the air and hope peace breaks out.

Yes, you are right. The Iraqis, and the middle east as a whole will need to work towards peace as well. We can provide support, which we are doing.

&gt; If you claim your goal is to defeat ISIS, you do your best to defeat ISIS.

Again, addressed above. Goal is to help others defeat ISIS.

&gt; You don't pretend as if you have no other choice than to sideline the strongest military on earth and rely on untrained militias.

The strongest military on earth tried to run that country for 8 years. Either they stay there forever, get shot at and blown up, or eventually hand it off to those militias and government forces.

If someone wants to tell me how many *more* years than that it will take to do it right, I'm all ears. And sure, I know you can't give an exact date. But hopefully we could come up with something more accurate than the difference between ""weeks rather than months"" and 8 years.

Did I say that? What I was getting at was that unilaterally going into Syria boots on the ground full force would be an invasion. Then going full surge into Libya instead of bombing and let the local resistance fight Quadaffi is another invasion. Then also continue to hold in Iraq, because we can't leave it? That seems like a whole lot of shock, awe, and occupation.

You're a fan of the Iraq invasion and Bush. Everything is Obama's fault. Nothing I say can convince you otherwise. Fine.

We approved funding for a shipment of equipment to the Kurds, which apparently has yet to be delivered. People have been complaining about the delays.

The Germans seem to be much better with the Kurds, in this regard. In addition to air support and training, they seem to have taken the lead in terms of providing arms and gear.

They seem to be more pro west and protective of minorities than other groups in the region. Which is good, but there are still issues.

Their relationship with Turkey is very problematic, and has to be at play in the larger political view. Which, frankly in my opinion just sucks and I wish Turkey could get past it some how.

In terms of minorities, yes. They are far better. Though there have been some discussions of possible peshmerga war crimes. And the fact that we still list the PKK as a terrorist group also mucks up support/arms. Again, all this isn't remotely close to ISIS. But it isn't 100% clean, either.

And the more abstract issues are about the goals of the Kurds. They have said that they don't want to try and liberate places that don't welcome them. With the religious/ethnic prejudices at play in the country, this is basically saying that they certainly won't fight in every place ISIS pops up.

Then, it seems to be an agreed upon theory that much of the Kurds aggressiveness is in order to hold more territory for what could be claimed as a future Kurdistan once the dust settles with ISIS. Now, I don't have many real problems with them. They appear to be some of the better actors in the region.

But if you wind up not caring about them taking territory, you can piss of the sunni and shia in the country as well. The Iraqi government loves peshmerga killing Isis, but wouldn't hesitate to attack peshmerga to prevent the establishment of an official Kurdistan.

And that is another dynamic at play: all strategies are under the assumption that Iraq should be maintained as a single country. Really going all in with the Kurds puts that bigger vision in jeopardy.

Who knows? Maybe splitting Iraq into 3 parts is better in the long run. But no one seems to even be remotely close to making that an official policy right now. For better or worse.




","&gt; I don't believe anyone wants ISIS to thrive and grow. However, the way in which we stop ISIS seems to me to have no consensus or clear outline of goals, or a way to achieve them. I'd love to hear from people who disagree and can outline the strategy for me.

2595,"&gt; I disagree. The Obama Administration is unwilling to pay the price for stability. It turns out they are running up the bill, and trying to bring stability here in 2014 is much harder than it would have been in 2011 - all because of this ""We aren't willing to pay any price to defeat ISIS"" mentality.

As I recall the negotiations to extend the SoF agreement in 2011, the sticking point was strict respect of Iraqi sovereignty.  The price the Obama administration wasn't willing to ""pay"" to extend the mission in Iraq was to potentially see American soldiers on trial in an Iraqi court.  Would you have paid that price? 
","&gt; Would you have paid that price?

You know, in general I think that US soldiers in a war zone who commit crimes should pay a price. I think a soldier who wears his uniform and goes out beyond the wire at night to kill civilians has committed treason. Not only disgracing the uniform and all those who wear it, but the act provides aid and comfort to the enemy; Aid in recruitment and comfort in feeling that the US is just a bunch of monsters.

However; I don't accept your premise that the Obama administration made a sincere effort to negotiate anything. He campaigned on removing troops from Iraq, and bragged about it in the presidential debates in 2012. I'm not sure what more evidence is needed to convince people that he had no intention of negotiating.

So to answer your question more specifically - I'd agree to letting US soldiers get tried for treasonous acts if they commit them. I think it is the #1 issue with the war on terror. We need to hold our own accountable.

As for the Obama administration making a sincere effort at negotiation, the principle of Iraqi sovereignty wasn't up for negotiation.  It had become a political issue in Iraq.

In general I think what a politician says to get elected and what they do when they actually find themselves in the chair only bear the vaguest of similarities (eg. read my lips, no more taxes).  In the majority of cases (and in particular for Obama) they stick closer to the status-quo than they do to their rhetoric.      ","The Obama administration has been a complete disaster in terms of the Middle East.

In broad terms, in the post-Cold War and post-9/11 period, the US government has focused on promoting stability and democracy (""Failed State"" prevention), preventing nuclear proliferation, and combating Islamic terrorism. Under Mr. Obama's watch, Libya has been transformed from stable autocracy to civil war/anarchy, Iraq has continued to disintegrate, and either Iran or Saudi Arabia (or both likely) will obtain nuclear weapons in the near future.

Key failures (in my opinion):

- Not pressing harder to maintain a contingent of American troops in Iraq under extended SOFA. It was clear, both in 2011 and in retrospect, that the Iraqi security forces were plagued by incompetence and prone to sectarian violence, and would be unable to keep the tenuous piece. American advisors may have been able to mollify some of the issues with the ISF (lack of professionalism, reliance on militias, and so forth), as well as preventing ISIS' territorial expansion.

- Not demanding a better rebuilding strategy from the British and French in regards to Libya. Obama signed off on a bombing campaign, with little thought to the consequences. One cannot build a country with cash, or create peace through airstrikes. Europe lacks the political will and the miltary strength to nation build, and Mr. Obama should have required our allies to come up with a better plan for us to sign on.

- Not considering the Gulf states' interests when dealing with Iran. Obviously Iran's nuclear weapons are problematic as far as our global strategy/belief in preventing nuclear proliferation, but Mr. Obama has maintained his focus purely on the nuclear side, and not what Israel/Arab states may want. This position has caused the Saudis to doubt our commitment to their defense, as seen by their (relatively) unilateral intervention in Yemen. If the Saudis and Israelis cannot count on American leadership they will take action themselves, and without our approval or blessing.

Overall, I don't think the problem is anything that Obama has done specifically, but it's that the president has been *reactive* as opposed to *proactive*. He deployed a brigade sized element to Iraq to combat ISIS *after* large swaths of Sunni territory fell to the group. He authorized airstrikes against Libya *after* civil war broke out and the British and French committed to supporting the rebels.

2616,"DPR Voting is intended to be a PR voting system for the House of Commons in the UK.
It is similar to AMS/MMP, variations of which are used in Scotland, Wales and Germany. 
It is a new system. It has not been adopted anywhere yet.
The similarities and differences, or advantages and disadvantages depend on whether you compare it with FPTP or AMS/MMP. 

Could it be used?
DPR Voting would be suitable for use in the UK General Election. 
The similarities in the voting process and organisation compared to FPTP would make it easier and cheaper to make a change because constituency boundaries would not change. Other forms of PR inevitably change the constituency boundaries and require candidate re-selection etc. 

Every voting system has some features which will be contentious and considered as disadvantages by some. The principal of proportionality is contentious to some.

DPR Voting achieves ‘Party’ proportionality, but the makeup of the parliament might not be ‘proportional’. By that I mean DPR Voting does not necessarily result in a parliament which is a microcosm of British Society. It does not necessarily result in a Parliament that consists of balanced proportions of age, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation etc. The MPs that are elected will each be the local choices, rather than party choices.

Depending on the quality and electoral success of their candidates, some parties may not have enough MPs to be adequately represented on all the Committees or ministerial positions in the event of a coalition. In this respect DPR Voting would be similar but no worse than FPTP. In fact it might be significantly better, depending on voter behaviour, but this is difficult to predict.

This form of party proportional representation requires some changes to the way parliament conducts its divisions. It would require MPs to use a form of electronic voting rather than the traditional lobby division voting system. So far MPs have resisted any change to electronic voting. 

A direct comparison with FPTP, and also with AMS/MMP (and even STV) would help explain the advantages of the system better, but this would make for a much longer post.

You are equivocating between the efficacy of religious forms of socialism and the intellectual and social compatibility between religion and socialism. Your original question, as well as /u/DramShopLaw's (and /u/grimeandreason's) replies, concerned the latter, but your response concerns the former, although based around where you placed it you seem to be implying it relates to the latter. Needless to say the question of whether or not any form of socialism (as opposed to progressivism or reformism) is net-beneficial for the poor is one that is still debated among economists and political theorists, so even if these movements were unsuccessful in that respect it is not clear that that would be attributable to the combination of religion and socialism as opposed to socialism itself.

&gt;Are the most religious nations the most socialist?

This raises significant questions and cannot be easily answered without clarifying your terms and methodology. How can we quantify how ""religious"" and especially how ""socialist"" a country is? Do we take the most ""socialist"" countries as Communist ones? Or do we see Communism and Socialism as separate ideologies? If we take the former, are historically Communist countries such as the USSR, Romania, North Korea, etc. to be taken as authentic representations of Communism or a corruption of Communist rhetoric? Moreover, what does it matter to your original question? Even if the *most* socialist countries aren't the most religious, that doesn't disprove that religion and socialism are compatible or even that socialism may be a closer approximation to the teachings of Christianity than Capitalism. And needless to say, Bernie's a moderate by historic and European standards for socialism - so bringing in the ""most socialist"" countries here seems even less relevant.",805,10,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

When people hear the word socialism they think of the NAZIs who self-labeled as socialists and conflate socialism with communism.

A lot of effort was put into demonizing any ideology even remotely associated with socialism or communism and the results of those efforts are still very much alive 2 decades after the wall fell.  Statistically, Socialism ranks lower than even atheism and islam in that order as positive factors in the eyes of voters.

As for the low religiosity of states with low income inequality, there is evidence that people use religion as social and thus financial support when they are less economically independant.  In economies were income inequality is low, people are less dependant on their immediate social ties and thus there isn't as strong an economic need to rely on traditional private safety nets such as churches and the like.  There is also less of a need for individuals to rely on those social ties to cope with their situation.","Given the rise in inequality, do you think moderate/liberal religion will  potential re-emerge from it's slumber?

EDIT: on religions power.. I'm a complexity theorist who specialises in cultural evolution. It's important to remember that in terms of identity, we don't transform as a society from religion to state to corporate consumer. What happens instead is that identities accumulate over time. They will likely all be represented for centuries to come, unless AI changes us beyond recognition. What does tend to transfer is which identity has overall power.

I quote from the last item: 

&gt; There is no reason to feel sentimental about the Electoral College. One of the main reasons the founders created it was slavery. The southern states liked the fact that their slaves, who would be excluded from a direct vote, would be counted — as three-fifths of a white person — when Electoral College votes were apportioned.

I'm not sure what you mean by the 3/5 compromise was ""way later"". It was originally an amendment to the Articles of Confederation, it failed there but was carried straight into the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and written right into Article 1 of the Constitution.

The assertion that the electoral college was there to prevent the rabble from electing the wrong person ('prevent ""mob rule""') simply isn't true. Most colonies (and then states) had laws on the books with a minimum property requirement for voting, a practice at the time that was legal under the un-amended Constitution. Women couldn't vote, slaves couldn't vote, property-less freemen couldn't vote, so the vote was pretty well out of the hands of the ""mob"".

Giving Southern states a number of electoral votes equal to the number of legislators was an overt way to keep the Southern states in the presidential selection process. That's why 8 of the first 9 presidents were Virginians; if Virginia slaves were not counted 3/5 toward the presidential election, Virginia wouldn't have been a major power in the election process at all.

This is a common misconception. The republic was used to represent people with the problems of the past, non instant communication, a base population that wasn't educated enough to vote intelligently, and the size of the early US. However the representation in a republic doesn't require equality and it was a battle under the articles of confederation that favored states individually to even get population to matter at all. In the end a compromise was made that established a precedent that is hard to change. The problem with the electoral college isn't necessary the fact that it exists, it is the first pass the post system (winner takes all) and the problems of having the electoral college able to vote against the % breakdown of their state that makes it undemocratic.


A good alternative is relative. If you believe that the government is for the people and not by the people an electoral college could stop a flash political change that all the sudden could elect a hitler because the college members could simply say screw the public and vote against democratic approval. If you think the government is by the people then a direct election method should be used over all else.

The problem exists in the way votes are tallied more than the electoral college itself. The spoiler effect.

Back then, communication was slow and verification of credentials was almost non-existent.  Our country was young and a highly valuable target for takeover.  We had a quantity of unowned land the size of which was never seen before or since.  The electoral college protected the interests of an independent nation significantly during a time when that protection was very necessary.

The fact that the president with the most votes has only lost - what... twice? - in very close elections proves that it works.

Personally, I don't think the uproar caused by such an election will ever be enough to stir the country to change the model.  The only time the populous ever thinks about it is during Presidential elections, and during close elections the interest wains in months - not nearly long enough to merit interest in a constitutional amendment.

This ""Republicans don't care"" meme is ultralame.","If you want to claim that the GOP is the same party that they were 25 years ago, then you have to admit that the ACA is a Republican Healthcare Plan.  That's not to say that ""republicans don't care"", but that the Reagan argument is a bad one.  Reagan did a lot of things that the current GOP would freak out over (Running away after a major terrorist attack on US soldiers, raising taxes on the middle class, telling the Prime Minister of Israel to go fuck himself when he was bombing Palestinians...)

Lest you think I am taking a side here- I am not happy with the bulk of the ACA fine print (not the major provisions though), and frankly disgusted with how it has been implemented.  However, during that period of time I saw the GOP put forward one and only one ""serious"" alternative- which was to allow plans to be sold across state lines.  And frankly, if massive insurance markets like Texas (fairly unregulated) and California (fairly over-regulated) end up with premiums that aren't very different from each other, I fail to see how that would have lowered the cost of insurance significantly nor how it would have insured those left out of the system.  (And honestly, it's such a blow in the face to states' rights that I fail to see how their own people would have passed it).

When people asked GOP spokespeople opposing reforms what doctors and Hospitals should do with the uninsured, the only GOP answer (if they even gave one) was along the lines of ""Well, maybe they shouldn't treat these people.""  Which is a round-about way of saying ""They should just die.""

So, when this major political party puts forward two ideas... one that's really just a token solution that won't change anything, and then when pressed comes up with ""Well, maybe the problem is that we treat the uninsured"", you are going to have to forgive me for taking this to the logical conclusion that the GOP platform was that people should just get sick and die.

2778,"First off, you seem to think that by demonstrating that individual Republicans have tried to fix things means that the GOP in general was able to come up with a proposal to insure the uninsured.  Nothing you presented above would have been passed by the 1994-2006 or 2008-2014 GOP controlled House.

Ezni:  Dated 2013, not 2009 which was the time frame of this discussion

Every American Insured Act, major points: Establishes State Exchanges and Provides for the Expansion of Medicaid in states where needed.

If these things are so important to the GOP, why are they trying to end them now?  Why have so many GOP governors blocked medicaid expansion in their states?

The ""Healthy Americans Act"" was universal healthcare.  The GOP would never have passed this.  So while individual Republicans may have supported it, the GOP never would have.

The ""Patient's Choice Act"" looks a lot like the ACA, but replaces the mandate and ban on pre-existing conditions with a regulatory body.  However, the GOP has continuously opposed many of the same features of that act while fighting the ACA.  So I think it's disingenuous to claim that they would support this- unless their support is contingent on who submitted the bill (which is a problem with both sides, true).

Voters do not educate themselves and have no real reason to do so and are ['rationally ignorant'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance) that is there is no benefit to the person to educate themselves beyond their own biases. (Why learn something that doesn't agree with me? [Part of the problem with true neutrality]) 

He notes that generally voters have several biases, or conclusions about the world that effect their world view.

A Make-work bias where voters tend to associate economic growth with job growth. 

An Anti-foreign bias in which voters tend to underestimate the benefits of trade.

A Pessimistic bias where voters overestimate the severity of economic problems and underestimate the past performance of the economy

A Anti-market bias where voters tend to underestimate the benefits of the functions of the market.  

Anyway to get back to my point, if the voters are irrational and don't know what is best, because they are uniformed then the politicians will not act on their behalf, because what voters think they want, based on their biases is not actually good for the country and conflicts with the advisors opinions.   In the end the politicians have to do a mix of both good and bad policies in order to ger re-elected but also pass policies that will actually produce results (so they can also get re-elected).

Other authors place the blame on the politicians themselves, since we assume that politicians are 'rational actors' (meaning they work in the own self-intrest) they will largely work in the area of appeasing special intrest this behavior is called ""rent-seeking"" and is a part of [public choice theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice).

[Party List](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_List)

Used in UK Parliamentary elections, Holland, South Africa, Israel, Austria, Sweden and a number of small countries.

Advantages:

- Fewer wasted votes

- No minority vote Governments

- Can form coalition Governments

-Voters will have several representatives for their region

- Use of a high threshold means a chaotic multi-party system is avoided.

Disadvantages:

- Coalition Governments can be unstable

- Extremist parties can win seats

- Parties can manipulate party lists to put rebels as least likely to be elected and so called 'Yes men' are the most likely.

[Single Transferable Vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote)

Used in Eire and some Northern Irish elections.

Advantages:

-The voter votes for an individual and not for a party so there's a stronger sense of accountability than in Party List.

- Coalitions are still likely with the usual problems and inherent instability. 

[Additional Member System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additional_Member_System)

Used in Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly elections, the London Assembly, and the German elections. 

Advantages:

- More proportional than our current system but retains the same democratic principles and advantages

- Retains voter-representative link.

- Can produce an overall majority vote party if public feeling is sufficient.

Disadvantages:

- Proportional voting systems mean smaller parties have a large influence and can cause a compromise of policy or ideology.

- Deals no one voted for can be produced, a notable case being Germany where a coalition Government was forged between the Socialist and the Conservatives - Yikes.

- Time period between negotiation between political parties when forging coalition Governments means instability throughout the nation.

- Extremists can win seats.

That I'm not so sure about. My guess is they would just shift resources more to cocaine and meth (and whatever fad drugs are off my radar). I'm sure they felt spread too thin having to enforce criminalized marijuana.

For an analogy, say they did away with laws against making moonshine and minors drinking alcohol. Do you think suddenly state and local police would suddenly downsize in response? Probably not, they still have plenty of other things to deal with.

Agency funding is up to legislators who write the budget, and I don't see anyone suggesting drastic cuts to funding the DEA just because the set of drugs they're concentrating on shifts.

2882,"[Here](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/b_sched_chron.pdf) is a list of the substances currently on the DEA schedule. While OP has listed some of the drugs by their ""street names"", the DEA list is a bit more clinical. 

There are definitely some drugs that shouldn't be Schedule I; MDMA, for instance, had known clinical applications before it was listed as Schedule I (used in couple's therapy). Methamphetamine was used clinically before other, less harsh versions came on the market; these versions are much better therapeutically, but that doesn't change the fact that methamphetamine does have clinical uses. Heroin, as an opiate, is a great painkiller. Oxy and other similar chemicals mimic its effects; it seems reasonable to say that heroin, too, has therapeutic use. That said, the standard isn't ""has a medical use"" - 

&gt;  no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.

The use has to be currently accepted. This is a bit of a catch-22; doctors can't prescribe Schedule I drugs, so there can't be ""currently accepted medical use in treatment IN THE US"" if doctors can't prescribe the drug. By this standard, though, street methamphetamine and heroin both fail - they aren't currently medically accepted (because better/safer versions exist); Desoxyn is methamphetamine that's Schedule II, but it's a pharma product, so I guess that makes it safer and more medically accepted? 

GHB is Schedule I, but according to the DEA's list, FDA-approved GHB products are Schedule III. Those products are used to treat narcolepsy and depression. My guess is that the ""street form"" of the drug would be Schedule I, but the pharmaceutical form would be Schedule III. 

LSD isn't widely accepted for medical use (though the studies are interesting), largely because it's hard to do the studies or get a large enough sample size to definitively show (in a controlled trial) that LSD helps cluster headaches. It primarily fails on the addictive requirement, but that's where most of these that make so little sense fail. 

My best guess at the logic here is that the FDA can overrule the DEA (to some extent), because it has to be medically accepted and FDA approval implies medical acceptance (though that does require lots of animal and human trials that are hard to get if it's Schedule I). If drug companies aren't motivated to get something through clinical trials, it stays classified as Schedule I. ","&gt;Because better/safer versions exist.

I'd say that's the key to why several drugs are on the list. They may have a medical application but if that application has been deprecated by drugs that are demonstratsbly superior in every facet, is that application actually practical? Heroin is a good example as it has obvious uses despite the existence of numerous replacements that match or beat its advantages over Morphine which it was intended to replace (I've been trying to find sources that show some area where it is superior to opioid alternatives so feel free to prove me wrong).",9536,18,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

It isn't easy, but you can get a prescription for it, it's called Desoxyn and is used for weight loss and ADHD treatment. 

For that matter, goddamn PCP (Phencyclidine, Sernyl, Sernylan) is fucking Schedule II as well.   I mean, good luck getting a prescription, but legally speaking, nothing is stopping your doctor from stroking you one. 

Cocaine is another matter.  Not only is it Schedule II, you'll find it in most hospital pharmacies because it's particularly useful in certain surgeries.  

Can't get heroin, but just about all the heavy hitter opioids are, from morphine to oxycodone.  

Our drug laws are *fucked*.  People talk about how they have to be illegal so that people don't get addicted and ruin their lives, but all the *really* dangerous drugs with the notable exception of heroin are all perfectly legal in the United States with a prescription.

2895,"&gt; What logic is the DEA using to keep these substances in Schedule I?

Their hands are tied by our international treaties and congress. ","I realize that this thread is seven days old, but there are a lot of wonky answers here that talk about political reasons, practical reasons, or just 'bad faith' reasons that the DEA does this. But that's not the real answer to your question. Sure, we can assume that the DEA has a vested interest in policing drugs and that, therefore, they will have an interest in having more drugs to police. But that is a weak, *weak* answer because it ignores the fact that the DEA *does* follow these factors and they have been found to have acted reasonably in scheduling marijuana (and other drugs) by federal courts a number of times. 

With that in mind, the (legal) answer is that the DEA can schedule drugs like this because the DEA gets to define what words like ""potential for abuse,"" ""currently accepted medical treatment,"" and ""accepted safety"" mean. These are ambiguous terms (i.e., reasonable people can differ as to what ""potential for abuse"" means). When a statute directing an enforcement agency to do certain things has ambiguous terms, the agency itself is empowered with the ability to define those terms in a way that they are workable. The agency gets to choose what Congress meant by saying ""potential for abuse,"" as long as it is a reasonable interpretation of that term. 

This is an important rule because it is truly impossible for Congress, when creating a statute covering such wide areas as drug abuse, to create legislation with such specificity that it can perfectly define every term and scenario that might be encountered. So the agency has to have some amount of discretion to fill in these gaps, otherwise enforcing the legislation would become unworkable. What's more is that, when an agency defines an ambiguous term, it is given Chevron deference - named after the case Chevron v. NRDC, if you care to read it. Essentially it means that courts must *defer* to the agency's interpretation as long as it is reasonable (i.e., the court can't decide that ""potential for abuse"" actually means X when the agency says it means Y, as long as Y is a reasonable definition of that term.

So, how does the DEA define these terms? They have created a list of subfactors that are more specific than the generalized scheduling factors that Congress put into the CWA. For instance, in order to determine if a substance has a ""currently accepted medical use,"" they look at the following factors:

&gt;(1) The drug's chemistry must be known and reproducible;
&gt;(2) there must be adequate safety studies;
&gt;(3) there must be adequate and well-controlled studies proving efficacy;
&gt;(4) the drug must be accepted by qualified experts; and
&gt;(5) the scientific evidence must be widely available.

[ACT v. DEA.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9842327817238142794&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=40000006)

(Notably, these five factors were created after the DEA was challenged about a previous 8 factor test that was even more vague [and potentially impossible for a currently scheduled substance to meet]). Obviously these are much more specific than the term in the CWA. But even these have some wiggle room. ""Adequate safety studies,"" ""adequate and well-controlled studies,"" ""widely available,"" ""qualified experts,"" etc. The agency *also* has the discretion to explain these terms.

So the point is that *you* may think it is transparently obvious that marijuana, to choose an example, has a ""currently accepted medical use."" But you are not considering the factors that the DEA considers to come to that conclusion. There may be certain studies, but the DEA may not credit them as ""well-controlled,"" or ""adequate."" You may find a doctor that says he accepts marijuana, but the DEA may not find him qualified, or may not find that that opinion is accepted widely enough. It is the DEA's opinion that matters here, not every individual member of the public. (More than that, actually, it's also the DHHS's opinion - and they agree with the DEA!)

So, why does marijuana (for example, again) not meet the ""currently accepted medical use"" factor? Well, the DEA helpfully explains in its denial of petitions to reschedule marijuana - of which there are several. Here's an excerpt:

&gt;To establish accepted medical use, the effectiveness of a drug must be established in well-controlled, well-designed, well-conducted, and well-documented scientific studies, including studies performed in a large number of patients (57 FR 10499, 1992). To date, such studies have not been performed. The small clinical trial studies with limited patients and short duration are not sufficient to establish medical utility. Studies of longer duration are needed to fully characterize the drug's efficacy and safety profile. Scientific reliability must be established in multiple clinical studies. Furthermore, anecdotal reports and isolated case reports are not adequate evidence to support an accepted medical use of marijuana (57 FR 10499, 1992). The evidence from clinical research and reviews of earlier clinical research does not meet this standard.

[Americans for Safe Access v. DEA, quoting Denial, 76 Fed. Reg. at 40,579.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7920687753832005040)

I'll pose the same question to you that I pose to others when this topic comes up - what part of that analysis do you find to be so unreasonable that you can say that the DEA has no basis for its decision? Because that's how a court would look at it. It's not enough that you disagree, or that you can choose other definitions that would change the result.

Better yet, here is the whole Federal Register document denying a petition to reschedule marijuana:  [Denial Of Petition To Initiate Proceedings To Reschedule Marijuana](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/07/08/2011-16994/denial-of-petition-to-initiate-proceedings-to-reschedule-marijuana). It is grotesquely long, detailed, and sourced with dozens of citations justifying the DEA's position on the matter. The idea that they are making these decisions without justification is completely unsupportable.

So the answer, to bring this full circle, is that there are multiple ways to interpret the definitions in the CWA. And the DEA is the one who is given the statutory power to decide which interpretation to follow. The premise of your question is inherently flawed - they do fit the definitions, just not definitions that you want the DEA to use. ",9536,31,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

It looks like Healthcare is quite affordable with this system. They are [listed](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44844/1/9789241564441_eng.pdf) as having really low health expenditures per person. 4.1% of GDP in 2009, compared with 10% in Sweden and 9.8% in the UK (Page 140, for those who are curious).

Also we are less concerned with catastrophic insurance (it makes very little difference if people pay a premium to a private company for it or if the government simply does a HSA yearly maximum subsidization) then we are with cost participation (everyone should pay something even if its very very small, $10 for a heart transplant for instance) and restoring price information to the market (people pay for things directly not via insurance).","I think this is the best answer so far, but who is ""we"" in the fourth paragraph?

Here is the solution for the high cost of healthcare in the US.

There has never been a proper market for healthcare. The doctor only profits when we are sick or injured. A good market would pay the doctor when we are healthy and cost the doctor when we are sick or injured 

We pay a subscription fee for medical insurance when we are healthy. The insurance companies pay doctors and hospitals a portion of that subscription fee when we are sick. US citizens pay private insurance companies 2.5 trillion dollars a year for access to doctors and hospitals. The insurance companies keep more of our money when we are healthy. The medical professionals only make money by charging the most they possibly can for visits and procedures. The incentives are all wrong and this is why medical costs are so high. We should pay doctors and hospitals a subscription fee when we are healthy in exchange for a commitment from doctors and hospitals to take care of every healthcare need. In other words, we should stop giving 2.5 trillion a year to insurance companies and give that money directly to the people that give us care. Doctors are hopefully smart people. They do not need a corporate gatekeeper with a Masters degree in business to dole out money to them. 
 
Here is how it would work. You pay your primary doctor each month who then contracts with a range of specialists and a hospital or two in your area. Your market choice becomes any primary care practice in your area. Your doctor is a part of a national reciprocation network that covers you when you travel and part of the money you pay your doctor goes into a national catastrophic fund for those rare illnesses that require travel and extended care. Prices would come down through competition. The hundreds of millions taken out in insurance company operations and profit could go to lower the price. Hospitals would be fully funded without having to admit a single patient so charging $80 for a box of tissues would end. Doctors would earn more money than investment bankers so the Doctors shortage would be over in a few years. The primary care doctor would be the center of the medical universe and he is already paid before you get sick so no unnecessary procedures or follow up visits. There would many alternatives like webcam diagnosis and phone call follow-ups that would be great for patients. How much illness is spread because Doctors cannot be paid unless sick people all gather and wait in the same room?
 
If we combine this change with strong malpractice tort reform then doctors will be able to reach out and be much more charitable. They will already be paid well so if we can limit the risk of giving care then doctors who are inclined to do so can give reduced rates or even free care for those who cannot afford their regular rates. In the US, the crux of the problem is charging by the visit or by the procedure. It is the wrong incentive. Doctors are paid more when the patient is sick. If you pay the doctor when you are healthy like you do the health insurance companies then the financial incentive to the doctor is to have you healthy and at home and not visiting or having a procedure.
 
A single person pays an average of $6,000 (including employer contributions) dollars a year for health care coverage. If that person is healthy he will see the doctor an average of three visits per year. Assume the average visit pays the doctor's practice $300. That is $900 dollars out of $6000 that goes to the doctor. Now suppose the entire $6,000 goes to the doctor. He uses half of that money to contract with a range of specialists practices and a hospital so that all of your local health needs are met. He also uses a bit of that half to add you to a reciprocation network so that you are fully covered when you travel. He also contributes a bit into a national catastrophic care fund that handles rare expensive cases that involve traveling to a specialist and experimental treatments etc. The doctor's practice now has $3000 guaranteed dollars from you instead of a speculative $900. That is more than three times what the doctor could eek out charging by visit. Everything but consumables is paid for. All salaries, the building, all the testing equipment is all paid in full before you arrive. The doctor is competing with the dozens of other practices in your community. The specialists and the hospitals are competing to be in the doctors networks. There is a lot of room for lower prices in this model. There is no compulsion to go back to the petrie dish waiting room for a follow up. much more cost effective for the doctor to call or skype. Internet medicine would no longer be stifled by insurance company or government rules. The internist or GP doctor would be the center of the medical universe as it should be.

Notice that this solution does not mention government. This plan would only require a consensus of courageous doctors to implement. The national average payout for medicare is more than $6000 a year. Government could pay the primary doctor on your behalf but the relationship and decisions would be between you and the doctor only. 
","To me, this just sounds like an insurance-based system, only you're asking doctors to manage it rather than business majors.

Not a good way to go about examination.  There's a lot of things that goes on in an examination that we just can't do through technology.

&gt;I want a doctor with a profit motive.

I can tell that you don't really understand healthcare as a profession or the people who want to work in it.  Is it really that hard to believe that there are people who are interested in more than money?  Are you making the assumption that doctors are not already doing everything in their power to heal patients?  Those who are genuinely concerned about patients make better doctors.  As your comment implies, people do not enter healthcare for the money, they do it because they want to help people and maybe make a difference in someone's life.  If no one wants to make the amount of sacrifice necessary to be a doctor, then why are there still too many applicants for too few spots?  

&gt;humans give the best possible care to their commodities. I want a doctor with a profit motive.

So, do salesmen have your best interest in mind?  Wanting to make a profit from you may not always be in your best interest.  What happens to people who can't afford to pay the subscription fees?

&gt;I would jump at the chance to not travel to sit in a room with sick people.

I realize that you don't want to be around sick people, but a virtual examination is not going to be as thorough as being there in person.  Every doctor distributing medical equipment advanced enough to even take your vitals to every patient is not feasible.  The costs would be enormous and the pros do not outweigh the cons.


I like your goals of increasing the number of doctors and giving them more freedom and autonomy while reducing their workload.  I just don't think this is the best way to accomplish those goals though, and I honestly don't really know how we can reform an entire nation's healthcare system either.  ","&gt;We have too many patients and not enough doctors, how is this going to happen?

The economic barriers to becoming a doctor will have been lifted. The fact that doctors can write their own ticket, design their own lifestyle is part of that. Most doctors will opt to profit more than half days.

&gt;You can't be serious about this. You're saying that most applicants to med schools are simply incompetent and that's why there's a 6% acceptance rate?

You are saying that only a small percentage of the population qualify to be a doctor. I do not accept that. Many popular professions of the last couple of decades have the intelligence to be doctors. The tech sector is one example, anyone who can code at a high level could learn to be a doctor. The financial sector is another, evaluating stocks and markets successfully requires quite a high level of reasoning. Both of these sectors offered easier better money. Both are somewhat fucked now. If medicine offered the payout many would take the harder road.

&gt;I can tell that you don't really understand healthcare as a profession or the people who want to work in it. Is it really that hard to believe that there are people who are interested in more than money?

Please give me a break with this. I want better doctors. I want doctors who will stand up and stop letting third parties take money from them. I do not want my doctor to have the herd mentality of a sheep waiting for others to tell him where to stand or what to do. I want a greedy fucking bastard of doctor.

&gt;So, do salesmen have your best interest in mind?

No - I am certain the guy that sold the CFO of the company you work for the health coverage that your family uses does not have my best interest or yours in mind. Salesmen do not make the bacon pork bellies are a commodity).

&gt;What happens to people who can't afford to pay the subscription fees?

The same thing that happened to people who could not afford doctors before the insurance companies and government made giving away medical care nearly impossible. Private charity and benevolent doctors would care for most of them.

&gt;I realize that you don't want to be around sick people, but a virtual examination is not going to be as thorough as being there in person. Every doctor distributing medical equipment advanced enough to even take your vitals to every patient is not feasible. The costs would be enormous and the pros do not outweigh the cons.

The doctor and the patient would make the call. I get sinus infections occasionally. I know the symptoms. When I have those symptoms and the doctor can confirm that remotely then he would be free to just call me in some antibiotics without the travel and the cost of a visit.

The tech for the medical monitoring is available now as smartphone add ons for a couple of hundred bucks or less. It would be an optional purchase for patients or a value add for doctors who need to attract patients.

&gt;and I honestly don't really know how we can reform an entire nation's healthcare system either.

We do not have to reform the nation's system. We simply need better doctors. If the doctors stand up then no one else has a choice but to follow their lead. Medicine should be delivered on the doctor's terms. They went to school, did the work, have the knowledge. We need better doctors to take back healthcare from the corporations and the government.",5123,69,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
2973,"I think you're misinterpreting what I mean when I say there is a low acceptance rate.  I think that there are *too many qualified applicants* for a very limited number of seats in the class.  Most medical schools have about 100 seats in the incoming class.  There are about 5,000 applicants for those 100 seats, and most of them are smart enough to be doctors.  If you attract more people from business, then there are 7,000 applicants for 100 seats.  In either case only the best make it in, and there are the same number of doctors churned out after 4 years, 100 new doctors.  This is what makes the situation different from most supply/demand models of business.  We have too many patients asking for more doctors and we have too many applicants who want to be doctors, but can't.  We are bottle necked at training.  We are not having a shortage of qualified applicants we are having a shortage of seats/medical schools.  If we suddenly have all doctors seeing 1/3 of the patients they currently do, then the other 2/3 are going to be waiting in line since there won't be enough doctors to go around.  Doctors are currently booked full and cutting their workload can only mean some people don't get to see a doctor at all.  The only way to fix the shortage of doctors is to open up more medical schools.

&gt;I want a greedy fucking bastard of doctor.

&gt;Private charity and benevolent doctors would care for most of them.

Completely contradictory.  I know the system now isn't working for them, but this isn't going to work either.  Flooding the field with greedy people isn't going to make relying on charity a feasible plan.

You may think virtual examinations are ok, but I wouldn't trust a patient to diagnose himself.  How do you know that Bob over there is as familiar with sinus infections as you are?  

&gt;I do not want my doctor to have the herd mentality of a sheep waiting for others to tell him where to stand or what to do.

Have you ever worked in healthcare or shadowed a doctor?  If you had then you would know that nobody tells a doctor what to do, their job is to take care of a patient how he sees fit.  If not, then who is and what's the purpose of having doctors at all?  From the patient's perspective they don't see the doctor for very long, but I can assure you they are not just standing around waiting for someone to tell them to see the next patient.  

You also keep saying that you want better doctors.  I think you may be underestimating what it takes to be a doctor.  They don't go through 8+ years of intense study and training for nothing.  And that's *if* they can get into a school.  A good doctor is one that knows his shit, and is willing to do everything necessary for a patient.  A mediocre doctor is one that knows his shit, but only wants to do the bare minimum for his patients.  If doctors start to consider the best interest of the patient secondary to money, he will perform the cheapest treatments possible.  If there's treatment A and treatment B and A costs $50,000 with a chance of success around 60% and treatment B costs $5,000 with a success rate of 30%.  It's more cost efficient for him to give you B since you pay one price, but he has to spend more on one over the other.  You would be better off with A, you would be more likely to be healed and get back to work.  It doesn't matter to him whether or not you can get back to work in 1 month or 3 as long as you can still pay him (assuming 2 months of subscription is less than 45,000).  That's one reason why I don't want greedy ass doctors.  There's more to healthcare than giving a patient a drug and sending them home.  They have to interact with patients and educate them, they have to workout what's best for the patient, not the doctor, the hospital, the HMO, or the government.  Doctors who can communicate well and have good relationships with their patients are less likely to be sued for malpractice because they can communicate that they have done everything the could and shown that they care about the patient and not just their wallet.  Currently hospitals and HMO's provide pressure for doctors to make money over the patient's best interest (unnecessary procedures to drive up cost), in your system it's the doctors putting pressure on themselves to cut costs, not necessarily at your benefit either.

When you say we need better doctors to stand up, I think you mean we need businessmen, politicians, and lawyers to help do this because most doctors have no business/economic/legislative experience and don't have the time to invest themselves into all of this at once.  We don't have mediocre healthcare because our doctors aren't good enough at practicing medicine, they're plenty good enough; it's the system that is not working effectively and it's not as simple as telling people to pay doctors directly.  There's gonna be a ton of bureaucratic bullshit to get there and we may not even end up with better care. ","&gt;I think you're misinterpreting what I mean when I say there is a low acceptance rate.

New schools will happen for determined candidates in an open market. Who has the incentive now to keep the number of doctors low? Answer the payers (insurance and government).

&gt;Have you ever worked in healthcare or shadowed a doctor?

I have for more than 20 years. I can assure you that many people tell doctors what to do. Insurance and government will not pay doctors who do not do what they say in terms of patient or treatment. Lawyers indirectly tell doctors not to take risks every time a lawsuit is filed. The patient has a voice but the doctor has to strain over all the other loud voices in his ear to hear them at all.

That right there is open and shut - a complete trashing of the 4th Amendment.

This issue alone justifies everything Snowden did.  And he did a lot more: the NSA has been subverting all of our cryptography, weakening it at a very low level.  This is, among other problems, a violation of the *2nd Amendment* of all things - and if you think that's crazy, go find out exactly why they tried to prosecute Phil Zimmerman about 25 years ago.  US law has long considered hard crypto a weapons tech; members of the Founding Fathers used encrypted letters on paper during the Revolution so this isn't a new concept.

Snowden also started a discussion on privacy that was much needed and expanded beyond merely his own releases.  As one example, a key NSA contractor was being allowed to do ""black hat hacking"" for profit.  Endgame was forced to get out of the business of buying previously unknown (""zero day"") exploits for Windows, iOS and the like:

Bastards were selling access to hacking services at $2.5mil per 25 machines hacked.  We hope it wasn't US government systems at risk but who knows.  We don't have a clue as to their customer base (other than the NSA of course) but the Endgame founders had previously done security work for large banks so that's a pretty decent guess.","Found illegal by whom?

What I think is clear is that Snowden repeatedly miscalculated here. It seems he didn't have sufficient understanding of all the diplomatic power that could be brought to bear against him.

Big corporations influence public opinion this way, and then they also influence public policy via campaign donations, ensuring that - to the level they can control - public policy and public opinion align with *their* goals.

If you allow the populace to elect their leader, eventually someone is going to attempt to run on a platform of, ""I'll give you something for nothing."" I.E. you won't have to work and you will still be supported by your government. This person often times gets elected because many people don't want to work, they want to be handed things. So you end up in a situation where more people are pulling from tax money for support than are paying taxes into the government. So the government borrows money to make up the difference. This goes on for a while and the country to driven deeper and deeper into debt. (The economic conditions mentioned in u/akevarsky is what made me think of this) Eventually the government begins to collapse under the weight of its own debt and the change that comes after is one that may be a move away from democracy.

Ok so we can look at that; the main cause of economic collapse in post-WW1 Germany were loss of land, tariffs and the Versailles Treaty. 

Prior to and during WW1 Germany had recently industrialized and was big in steel production especially taking over the Alsace-Lorraine further pushed them along in steel production.  After the war they lost territory, including the Alsace-Lorraine region.  They received money from the US to help rebuild, but once the Great Depression hit it effected the world and of course, Germany.

It was spending on infrastructure and military that brought the German economy back; very military Keynesian. Although this was short term because they neglected everything else.  But if you want to get into that you can look at Hjalmar Schacht who was in charge of economics in Germany in WWII.  Who also saw the benefit of having a fiat currency and kept interest rates low and the deficit high.  Germany saw the largest jump in employment than any other country during the course of the Great Depression. Of course Hitler later fired Schacht and destroyed the German economy himself.

3136,"Adding on to what /u/Jewnadian has said, I'd argue that events such as the one in Ukraine are aberrations in a larger continuum. Governments don't turn away from the idea of consent of the governed. While they may greatly abridge the rights of its citizens, governments will still seek to maintain the consent of the governed (look at North Korea and its expansive propaganda program designed to keep people loyal). Tied closely to the ideas of democracy and consent of the governed is the idea of popular sovereignty, that a government derives its just powers from the people. While in the past there have been many governments claiming their rights to rule from other sources, including tradition or the divine right of kings, we find far fewer governments—if any—that make such a claim. 

To address your last question, when a government rejects democracy, it is often through the will of the people. The Germany philosopher [Max Weber](http://anthropos-lab.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Weber-Politics-as-a-Vocation.pdf) argues that changes from legal legitimacy (constitutional or often democratic rule) to charismatic legitimacy (rule by a charismatic individual) happens when economic or political turmoil rock a nation. We see this occurring in post WWI Germany and during the French Revolution with Napoleon Bonaparte. When these governments **do** reject democracy, it is often through popular mandate. While some might argue that the Nazis did not rise through popular choice, the party was still **immensely** popular. 

For further reading, you can look at the political scientist Francis Fukuyama who argues in [The End of History and the Last Man](http://ps321.community.uaf.edu/files/2012/10/Fukuyama-End-of-history-article.pdf) that history is a trend towards the western liberal democracy and that its ideals of limited government and constitutionalism will become more and more universal.

What is most interesting about Ukraine right now is, where is the crisis that would justify the power grab to the population. This is pretty bold.","I think that there are certain situations that may justify non-democratic governance:  

-  Acute state of crisis: The country is in turmoil. There is no possibility for democratic processes. Lincoln was temporarily in such a situation. 
- Ongoing state of crisis / civil war: It may be that there is an ongoing crisis, for example a civil war where there would be enough time and the right infrastructure to organise elections and votes, but there are two or more parties that can't agree on basics and that block each others, thus paralising the democratic system. Ex-Yougoslavia may have been such a situation. As long as there was a strong ""benevolant dictator"" ([Tito](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josip_Broz_Tito)), the country worked well. When he died, there was civil war.

In both these situations, I think it's to a limited extend justified to turn away from democracy.

&gt;By Krugman's own admission, the two worst panics occurred after the Fed was formed. 

This is a near meaningless statement.  Why are we only examining the two ""worst"" panics?  How do you qualify ""worst"", by the largest single-day drop?  And what if the worst two panics are offset by much more frequent panics that are nearly as ""bad"" (whatever that means)?  

It's this kind of loose arguing that causes many to talk about a school being right because it ""has a 2 for 2 record"" on predicting the current recession and the and real estate bubble.  Besides the lack of a priori predictions specific enough to be held up as hypotheses, this also *throws out all the other cases, when the same people/school/model might have been wrong*, noting only the ones that are more notable.  This is highly fallacious reasoning, but it seems to convince a lot of people.

Everything done here is post-hoc analysis and claims of causality based on correlation.

&gt; Georgia secretary of state and gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp improperly purged more than 340,000 voters from the state&amp;#039;s registration rolls, an investigation charges.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s the latest voting rights controversy to crop up in the Georgia governor&amp;#039;s race, which pits Republican Kemp against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who if elected would become the first African American woman governor of any state.

&gt; &amp;quot;Brian Kemp has abused his power as secretary of state of Georgia to purge the voting rolls of Georgia primarily of black and brown people,&amp;quot; said Joe Beasley, an Atlanta civil rights activist.

3287,"*Under Georgia procedures, registered voters who have not cast ballots for three years are sent a notice asking them to confirm they still live at their address. If they don’t return it, they are marked inactive. If they don’t vote for two more general elections after that, they are removed from the rolls.*

&amp;#x200B;

So...**5 years** the voter had to confirm residency - after 3 years of not voting, they are given ""suspended registration"" during which time they can still vote. If they do, their registration is validated and current.  And u/ieattime20 would have you believe that registrants shouldn't be bothered to vote, much less maintain their public records.

What u/ieattime20 also doesn't want you to know is that the [SCOTUS actually confirmed](https://politics.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/supreme-court-allows-voter-purges-states-like-georgia/TJZqgnWEAWOBvUMdB9eDOP/) and validated Georgia's, and other states' voter purge laws as they comply with the 1993 National Voter Registration Act.

3289,"One, the SCOTUS did not confirm that our ""exact match' system was in compliance with the NVR Act because it never got to them. [Georgia settled the suit and agreed to never use it again in 2016-2017](https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-settles-federal-lawsuit-alleging-blocked-thousands-minority-voters/4M2dMAHDRvC8fLYoV01fxN/). Then Kemp used it again.

Two, this method of purging due to inactivity is not automatic. It was initiated by Kemp in election year. And it's clearly a bad method, as its goal was to remove only voters that moved to other precincts and guess what? It didn't. Maybe not sending out a single small postcard to an address you don't think is correct is a better way to go, as these people routinely say they never got notice.

Three and finally, *you do not have to perform arbitrary nonfunctional and bad faith rituals to retain your fundamental rights*. Given the voting rate in the United States, *any* law that purges voters due to inactivity has to result in less voter registration. Voting is not mandatory, but it *is not a privilege, it is a right*.

Again, El would have you believe that Kemp, in the tightest race for governorship in the country, using methods that the State settled out of court and agreed it wouldn't use, in his own election, with the result of *hundreds of thousands of people* being purged for having moved when they did not move, is acting in good faith. It is, frankly, fucking absurd. 

El also claims this without providing evidence and by making provably false claims.","&gt;he SCOTUS did not confirm that our ""exact match' system was in compliance with the NVR Act because it never got to them.

I didn't say anything about exact match, sparky.  The article is about Georgia's purge law.  Try to keep up. 

&gt;Two, this method of purging due to inactivity is not automatic.

It actually is automatic - the clock started in 2013 - which was NOT an election year. 

&gt;And it's clearly a bad method, as its goal was to remove only voters that moved to other precincts

False

&gt;Maybe not sending out a single small postcard to an address you don't think is correct is a better way to go

You mean, the address on file and in public records? How else to contact the registrant, champ?

&gt;you do not have to perform arbitrary nonfunctional and bad faith rituals to retain your fundamental rights. 

So, what you're trying to say is that registrant MUST NOT be asked to ensure their information is up-to-date?  Ever?  

&gt;any law that purges voters due to inactivity has to result in less voter registration.

No shit. 

&gt;Voting is not mandatory, but it is not a privilege, it is a right.

And a right that relies on accurate public records. If a person doesn't take the time and effort to ensure his/her public records are correct, they have no room to bitch and moan about not being able to participate in an action that *requires* proof of individuality. It isn't that hard a concept. 

&gt;El also claims this without providing evidence and by making provably false claims.

3291,"&gt;It actually is automatic - the clock started in 2013 - which was NOT an election year. 

And it was initiated by Kemp in this election. Waiting until after the election would ensure maximum voter turnout, which anyone who cares about democracy wants.

&gt;You mean, the address on file and in public records?

I mean a single fucking notice prone to the vagrancies of our mail system. Any party who actually wants to contact another party in the United States sends multiple requests. See bill collectors, courts, local and state governments, etc. Except for voter registration.

&gt;So, what you're trying to say is that registrant MUST NOT be asked to ensure their information is up-to-date? Ever? 

Of course they should. And in Georgia, they are, when they attempt to vote. This is why we have such low voter fraud in the United States. Not because we routinely disenfranchise people arbitrarily. *That's* why we have rampant voter suppression.

&gt;And a right that relies on accurate public records.

Public records that are verified before any attempt to vote. There was no need for this purge, as evidenced by the fact that it wrongfully disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of people.

&gt;Knowing you have an incessant need for sources, I provided them.

Good. You're learning how actual arguments work.

&gt;All you've done is obfuscate and deflect. That's your shtick. 

Once again, my FUCKING SIDES.","Bro - you and I have had some intense debates and I've enjoyed all of them - mostly because they've exposed some perspectives and thought processes I've not considered before. But, these GA debates, you are intentionally misrepresenting the intent of the laws. 

&gt;And it was initiated by Kemp in this election.

It was initiated in 2013 - that's the 5 year mark.  2018 - 5 = 2013.  Simple stuff. 

&gt;I mean a single fucking notice prone to the vagrancies of our mail system.

Good god...now you're just getting desperate. 

&gt; Any party who actually wants to contact another party in the United States sends multiple requests.

Nothing in the article indicates the respondents were only notified a single time. 

&gt;Not because we routinely disenfranchise people arbitrarily.

How else to fucking touch base with people who haven't voted or updated their registration **IN 5 YEARS**?? A person must be registered to vote in order to vote. Showing up to a polling location and claiming ""Hey...I'm u/ieattime20! Trust me!"" isn't a valid form of ID verification. 

&gt;There was no need for this purge

There is quite obviously a *persistent* need to purge voter rolls.

&gt;Once again, my FUCKING SIDES.

I'd probably try to laugh away getting called out on bullshit, too.  Your shtick is well known in this sub.  ",8301,25,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics
3297,"&gt;No, it didn't.

Well yeah they purged people who hadn't moved. So the policy lacks solvency. Provided the intent of the policy is actually at stake here,and not some other intent.
&gt;The SCOTUS ruled that no response from the registrant related to Georgia's purge notifications is legal and in accordance with the 1973 Voting Rights Act. Nice try though.

The basis for that ruling is that, even though inactivity alone is not enough to forego your voting registration, if that inactivity is done in the pursuit of keeping accurate voting records for purposes of determining if someone moves (i.e. they have to send at least a notice) then it is legal. Again, the basis *matters* in the courts El.
&gt;Show me the law where it says Georgia only has to send a single notice...and show me proof that Georgia only sent a single notice.

I've provided two articles showing that's what they did. If you have some other compelling evidence I'm all ears, but your incredulity isn't an argument.
&gt;Another assumption on your part.

No it's not. It's *how state governments fucking work*. 
&gt;See, your persistently arguing that a citizen has no responsibility to ensure their voting registration information is maintained.

They do. They fulfill that responsibility when they register, and at the time that they vote, by providing their registration. I have consistently argued that the state cannot come up with wild pretenses to revoke that right with the clear intent to minimize voting, especially when that's the result.","&gt; How else to fucking touch base with people who haven't voted or updated their registration IN 5 YEARS??

I recently watched some old YouTube videos from the 60's of William F Buckley interviewing Allen Ginsberg, and man, you could not have a more cordial exchange between two people with polar opposite views of the world. We have regressed a significant amount over the last 50 years when it comes to tolerance and acceptance of opposing ideas. It's completely close minded, anti-intellectual behavior fostered by an almost religious like fervor. I think you've had a lot of people trade in traditional religions for new ones. Funny that, people being tribal. Go figure.

I think part of the problem is that as living conditions have improved over the last 50 years and many societal issues were largely resolved to a satisfactory degree, the politics of both right and left had to become more extreme to differentiate themselves. As they became more extreme, they had a harder time rationally defending their positions and it became more about appealing to emotion and fear of the other side, making the rift even larger.

Well, it's interesting that you specifically say, they could see the other side as ""evil"" or ""greedy"". Is that really at all compatible with moderation? If you see the other side that way, it doesn't seem possible that you'd then be moderate enough to change your mind when presented with new information. If you are, then I wouldn't say you ever truly thought of the other side as ""evil"" or ""greedy"".

And actually, I still stand by my point about moderation as opposed to centrism. The idea that it's better to be open minded and accepting is itself a pitfall. Yes, we believe that it's better to be moderate and open-minded, and that's what makes us moderates. What I'm saying is that there's a danger of our faith in moderation turning into pretentiousness, when we start acting like our open-mindedness makes us inherently better people.

Or put it this way. Liberals presumably hate it when conservatives act like they have a headstart in an argument because they're more logical and intelligent. Conservatives hate it when liberals act like they're more moral and thoughtful. I just feel like there's a big danger of the same happening to moderates; that both liberals and conservatives get put off by moderates, because we appear on our high horses and act like our open-mindedness is automatically a point in our favour.

And the reason I brought all this up in the first place, is because I feel like this article either reaches or is approaching that danger zone. It's easy for us to read ""humility is the fundamental virtue"" and be like, ""yep, totes agree, moderates ftw"", but that's because we're moderates. To someone who doesn't identify themselves as such, this comes across as incredibly pretentious self-flattery, and doesn't do anything to actually reach out to people.

I don't doubt that humility is at the heart of good discourse, nor do I think it isn't at least a major part of being a moderate. I'm just sceptical of how helpful it is to talk about it in such terms. I think it might be partly a subtle difference between ""it's always good to be humble"", and ""moderates are always humble"". The latter is essentially what is being said in the article. It's a list of points about ""what moderates believe"", with ""humility is the fundamental virtue"" being one of them; the implication here is that that's unique to moderates, and therefore an insult to readers who wouldn't describe themselves as such.

As an analogy that I think you might understand well, think about sexual harassment. Now, an overwhelming proportion of sexual harassment cases are perpetrated against women. But is it actually helpful to frame the war against sexual harassment as an explicitly feminist thing? If you're convinced by ""sexual harassment against women is bad"", you'd just as easily be convinced by ""sexual harassment is bad"", full stop. All the former really adds is the danger of alienating men who would otherwise gladly denounce sexual harassment, but are put off by the women-first rhetoric attached to it.

If I got that right, then I fully agree.

Behavior like what I had in the parentheses is what I think we should hold up as just the general standard for society. It should especially be the expected behavior for politicians. I think one of the bigger issues today is the attachment people make between their identity and political labels. There's less concern about actual ideas on policy and more focus on protecting one's own label or tarnishing the opposition.

Just look at discussions whenever there's a mass shooting. There's usually heavy focus on trying to label the shooter as a conservative/liberal followed by inane semantic debates on what makes someone a liberal or conservative.

But it was also a crew of 7 of us working all summer, and we repaired maybe 5 miles of trail? It was a lot of stone and rock steps in a wilderness area, which meant we weren't allowed to use anything gas or electric powered to move 200 lb granite boulders into place.

We had another crew that was going lighter, but more wide-ranging work as well. They would hike 4-6 miles a day, carrying saws, axes, shovels, and 35lb pry bars with them to remove any fallen trees/rocks on the trails.

The point is these kinds of jobs were tough, physically demanding, and sometimes frustrating, but really important to maintaining our trail system. It's not Sexy, but it does pay well and get you in peak physical condition. ",3687,4,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics

This goes beyond just Trump and the Russia investigation. 
 
He is discrediting any and every investigation conducted on any politician, especially those where a Democrat was not convicted and where a republican was convicted. So say the FBI starts investigating a certain money frail that goes from a foreign entity in to a 501c that makes its way to a republican candidate. If the FBI investigates that candidate and it leaks to the public, the opinion of the president is already out there and his supporters will automatically believe its a witch hunt because ""the FBI leadership is bias against Republicans"" when it very well could in fact be a foreign government throwing money in our elections. What if a Democrat is accused of the same thing but there's no evidence of it? If the FBI doesn't publicly disclose their investigation of it or refused to, the whole ""see they're biased!"" can be dragged out. 
 
That's the real fucked up part. The FBI can't do its job unless it's easy on Republicans and harsh on democrats. I wonder if this will stop at politicians and not trickle down to individuals being investigated and they won't be asked or have their political activity researched.

Well, for one thing, *similar* situation and *same* situation are not the same thing.

1: You're driving down the highway, you car's tire throws a rock off the overpass and it hits a car below, killing the driver.

2: You're driving down the highway and get a flat tire. You pull over, but there's a big rock blocking where you need to put your jack. You toss the rock off the overpass and it hits a car below, killing the driver.

3: You pull over on an overpass. You're bored. You pick up a big rock and see if you can drop it on a car passing below. You hit the car, killing the driver.

4: You know that your ex-husband drives under this exact overpass every day. You've pulled over and watched for him and know he is in the middle lane each time. You get a big rock, and drop it, hitting his car and killing the driver.

Four situations where a rock kills a driver. 1 is not even a crime. 2 through 4 are.

If I'm Fox News, and Hillary Clinton was in situation 1, I write a story that says, ""Hillary throws rock from bridge, killing someone. Lock her up.""  If Donald Trump is in situation 3, I write: ""Driver's death was a complete accident. Trump didn't mean to kill anyone"".

We have a majority of complaints about gerrymandering and voter disenrollment by Republicans, and yes there have been instances of it being done by Democrats also, but the vast majority of the complaints are being done by Republicans by far.

  


I also like to point out that one side has used and continues to use Cambridge Analytical (or whatever their newest daughter company is called as the all have the same key members) that have been caught on tape by BBC reporters bragging about the lengths they will go to including highly illegal means to skew public opinion, that same company that is being investigated by multiple countries at this very time for illegal practices.

  


Then we have also seen a rise of overt racism, and the GOP embracing many of these candidates, along with the daily demonization of brown people by the president himself.

","A lot of people just don't know anything about what is really going on in the news.  They see headlines on their social media feeds, maybe on the homepage of their mail site, and the occasional link on reddit or a headline on a newspaper or magazine in passing.  Outside that few seem to care to go beyond the surface and learn about what's going on.

I was visiting a friend the other day and asked them what they thought about some current events and I was surprised that an intelligent and educated person such as her just absorbed headlines but knew little outside that.  With jobs, bills, school, and other life concerns its not too hard to see why many don't put in the time, but it can be concerning that these are the same people who vote for public officials.

To answer your question though, Russia's (and therefor Putin's) only real interest is to maintain a profitable political and economic relationship with the Assad government.  It helps that he can poke the West in the eye while he's at it.  I don't think he wants to see Syria using chemical weapons, but they don't control Assad, and the only pressure they could assert would mean loss in business.

Also, its true that US citizens don't want to go into Syria, but its false to think that the US government (Obama, the military, congress, etc) want to go in as well.

Perhaps the strongest argument against an appreciable human contribution to climate patterns comes from the observed cooling that took place between 1940 and 1975, and the lack of warming since 1979 (in the weather balloon and satellite data).

The Earth's climate has never been steady; it has either warmed or cooled -- without any human intervention -- since the dawn of time. The measured variations have often been larger and more rapid than those currently predicted by climate models for the year 2100. In the last 3,000 years, temperatures in the North Atlantic have changed by as much as 3°C within a few decades.","That petition is really old and to my knowledge was debunked years ago:

3571,"&gt; I don't understand what message you're trying to get across. 

I'm not sure how to say it more clearly and succinctly, but I'll try to reply to your questions.

&gt;That people on the left are capable of being hypocritical? We're all capable of being hypocritical. 

I agree, however that is why we hold leadership up to higher standards. Just like we can all post on facebook or reddit, but we hold journalists to higher standards.

&gt;That people on the left are more likely to be hypocritical? That's not something you can glean from one example.

I agree. That's why I am in here providing the examples when I see them.

But you seem to be really missing the sexism behind this comment. The fear mongering. All the things that a moderate position should be pointing out when a leader is saying it.

You have this focus on the word hypocrisy, but don't seem to want to discuss what is hypocritical.

It's the way that this kind of sexism is treated as ""ho-hum"" no problem. That is the hypocrisy.

The hypocrisy is the difference in the ways that people react to the same core principle - So I am using this hypocrisy as a call against a ""I am with the good guys and you are all evil"" narrative like Michelle Obama has expressed.

&gt;And let's say the ""left are hypocritical"", whatever that may mean.

To define this some more for you I will say specifically the Media and pop-culture and those who traditionally vote democrat? People who said Michelle Obama should run for office?

&gt;How does that impact what we do, what we say, how we vote?

Perhaps realizing the hypocrisy pulls people back a bit from the  ""I am with the good guys and you are all evil"" narrative that I believe is driving the hypocrisy of which we speak.

&gt;If someone on the left proposes something, do we instantly say, ""urgh, no, the left are hypocritical!""?

You seem to really be running this one out here.... I mean - when people on the left hear this kind of sexism from Hillary Clinton or Michele Obama or Elizabeth Warren they should stop and say ""urgh, no, the left are hypocritical!"".... perhaps a ""You know what, Gnome, you are right! This is clear hypocrisy - and it isn't the first time I've heard the argument either! In fact, this argument has been around for a while! It's why Michele Obama can say it and think that there is nothing wrong with saying it! She believes it! And maybe those of us who love her need to tell her to change!""

You know - basically the same argument from many on the left about Trump when he is a Hypocrite.

&gt; No, we'd obviously consider the proposal on its own merits.

In this particular case, what are the merits? Are you telling me this is the first time you've heard this argument that Michelle Obama is making?

&gt;If someone on the left believes something, do we instantly oppose them because the ""left are hypocritical""?

Now you have taken this thought process of your own device somewhere I didn't take it at all. I asked you to look at this example of hypocrisy from the left?

Are you saying you don't find it hypocritical in any way?

&gt;If you're reading this and left-wing, feel free to replace every instance of ""left"" in this rant with ""right"", because it's equally applicable.

So why shouldn't I be pointing out the hypocrisy again? I'm confused by your conclusion. You seem to be saying that this isn't an example of hypocrisy and I am just writing it off as if all the left is hypocritical... But I believe I am using this example to illustrate the long standing argument is in fact the ""perceived political enemy"" argument you are decrying.

SO how do I call out this example of hypocrisy without calling it ""Hypocrisy""?

In my belief, this is a long standing ""Only real women vote Democrat"" argument from the left. I have this belief because I recall I noticed it in Highschool back before the internet was created.... So for quite a while now.

At what point do I get to challenge this Idea as both a example of left wing belief and hypocrisy?","Whoa, ok. All of my questions were rhetorical; they were just pointing out the pointlessness of ascribing hypocrisy to the left. And, like, obviously that last sentence wasn't directed at you, it was directed at all the left-wingers who also happened to be reading my comment. Like, c'mon, man.

But, you do seem to get what I'm saying when you say, ""why shouldn't I be pointing out the hypocrisy again?"" which is the important question to answer. Because that's what I'm saying, that it's not particularly helpful in the grand scheme of things to be doling out examples of hypocrisy like they have any effect on politics.

So I'm going to rewrite my previous comment here, but phrase it in a way that you don't mistake each rhetorical question as something to be answered, and instead make it an explicit argument. Sorry I didn't do this initially. I also realise this means I'm not going to answer any of your replies to my ""questions""; that's not because I can't, but because I believe what I'm about to write answers every single one of them, and you're free to bring up any individual point again if you don't think it has been answered satisfactorily.

The ascribing of attributes to a group of people, in both ""great example of hypocrisy from the left"", and ""Words of Wisdom from the Left"", is not helpful to political discussion. This is partly because, as I illustrated in my first paragraph in the previous comment, it doesn't mean anything. There is no substantive content offered by the phrase ""from the left"". Hypocrisy is the same whether it comes from the left or the right; the problem isn't with people being left or right, the problem is with the hypocrisy. So there is no additional point you're making by attributing this hypocrisy to ""the left"".

The other reason, as I illustrated in my second paragraph in the previous comment, is that there is no perlocutionary force to the statement. No one on the left or the centre is going to have their minds changed through an ""example of hypocrisy from the left""; that is because one example has no effect on the greater political ideology, and many examples of poor implementation have no effect on the underlying theory. No one on the right or the centre is going to gain anything but emotional satisfaction from an ""example of hypocrisy from the left"".

Now, to address the other key question you asked, yes, you're right that I do not believe Michelle's comments today are an example of sexism and hypocrisy. ""Any woman who voted against Clinton voted against their own voice. Well, to me that just says you don't like your voice. You like the thing you're told to like."" I don't think it's a bad thing to vote against your own voice. Like I said in my other comment, many women genuinely don't care about their own voice being heard, and that's perfectly fine. I therefore don't think it's a criticism of any woman to say they don't like their voice, or that they like what they're told to like.

Now, that is my opinion of it. Does Michelle feel the same way? Almost certainly not; she'd probably say that it *is* a bad thing to not like your own voice, and that it's better for women to vote as feminists. But that's not a moral judgement on Clinton/Trump supporters; that's a moral judgement on the state of being a feminist. Michelle thinks it's better to be a feminist; of course she does, she's a feminist. Because she thinks it's better to be a feminist, she *therefore* thinks it's better to have voted Clinton. Only through the understanding that she thinks it's better for a woman to be a feminist can you reach the conclusion that she's bashing Trump-supporting women here; however, the actual things she's said in this link, by themselves, are not moral judgements in any way. Any moral judgement she's making on political affiliation is derived from a completely separate moral judgement on feminist affiliation, which is not mentioned in these remarks.

By the way, one suggestion I have for you, is to quote whole paragraphs to reply to, rather than individual sentences. That way you don't lose the context of every thing you quote, and lead to hilarious misunderstandings like what happened in the other comment.

I understand. Can't let anyone think you are one of the bad guys, gnome sane?","Funny thing is, while Michelle doesn't have the sentiment I do about this, I'd say the exact same thing. If you're a woman and voted for Trump, well, you're not a feminist. And at some point, our society has to accept that that's *not necessarily a bad thing*. There are countless women who don't ""like their own voice"", who ""like what they're told to like"", and they live very happy lives and we shouldn't be trying to force them into something they don't want.

Of course, there are also countless women who *don't* want to sit down, shut up and obey their men; that's what the feminist movement is all about. Just their sheer existence shows that their needs also need to be met.

So the whole thing is stemming from this strange situation we've got ourselves into, where a whole country votes for a single person based on ideological issues, when *obviously* the people in the country have different ideologies.

&gt; And at some point, our society has to accept that that's not necessarily a bad thing.

I'm so happy to disagree with you, and sorry you feel this way.

&gt;If you want to be a quiet, traditional, family woman, that's your right; but you inevitably screw over countless other women by voting against Hillary.

So not only do you think that real women have to vote democrat or else they are not real women... but you also think women who do not vote democrat are screwing over the ""real women"".

&gt;Well, we haven't quite started killing each other en masse over this yet, so we can carry on like this a bit longer.

I'm truly shocked you don't see the hypocrisy in your comments or in Michelle's comments... and you seem to be very deep in the ""We are the good guys and they are evil"" mindset.","Ok, so this reply is going to be a little technical and semantic, because that's what the issue here is. It's not an exaggeration to say you've misunderstood every single line you just quoted; that's not a problem, I'm happy to go through each one.

&gt; If you're a woman and voted for Trump, well, you're not a feminist. And at some point, our society has to accept that that's not necessarily a bad thing.

These two sentences need to be taken together. The crucial word here is the ""that"" in ""that's not necessarily a bad thing"". What does the word ""that"" refer to? Now, you seem to have taken the meaning that ""that"" refers to ""all women have to vote Democrat to be a real woman"". You'll notice, however, that that never appeared in my comment. Instead, I feel it's reasonably clear that the ""that"" refers to the phrase: ""you're not a feminist"".

I'm saying that it's *not a bad thing if you're not a feminist*.

So in answer to your first two questions, no, of course I don't think it's a sexist or hypocritical statement, because I'm not making any moral judgements on women who aren't feminists (if you mean Michelle, then actually, yes, it's not a great statement, but I'm going to refer to that in the other comment). And no, I'm not ""arguing that all women have to vote Democrat to be a real woman"". I have no concept of ""real woman""; every woman is a ""real woman"". If anything, I'm arguing that women can vote for anyone they want, as you can see from my previous quote, ""they live very happy lives and we shouldn't be trying to force them into something they don't want.""

&gt; If you want to be a quiet, traditional, family woman, that's your right; but you inevitably screw over countless other women by voting against Hillary.

You'll notice, once again, that I have not made any moral judgements on the ""quiet, traditional, family woman"". Nor has the word ""real"" come up in this quote, or really any quote I made. I'm saying that the ""quiet, traditional, family women"", aka the women more likely to vote Trump, are screwing over other women, aka the women more likely to vote Hillary, and you'll notice that there's no moral judgement over who's ""in the right"" there; it's an objective fact. This objectivity is portrayed further when I make the parallel claim, that those who vote Hillary are screwing over those who vote Trump, in the second half of that paragraph that you conveniently forgot to quote.

I believe the problem may be that when I said the word ""feminist"", your mind automatically substituted that with ""real women"". That's a shame, because I did try to define ""feminist"" properly and objectively: hence the quote, ""women who don't want to sit down, shut up and obey their men; that's what the feminist movement is all about."" That is to say, there is a specific subset of women in the world who are ""feminists"", and that therefore there are also many women who aren't feminists. Once again, just to drill this in, at no point do I make any moral judgements about either. Both feminists and non-feminists are ""real women"". I don't blame you for this mistake; too often, we do hear feminists use the word ""feminist"" morally, and imply that non-feminists are morally inferior. In fact, in context, Michelle is doing this to a significant extent. I, however, am not. For you to assume that I am is not productive to the discussion.

So there you go, I hope I cleared up what I was talking about. Sorry to be handling you with kid gloves on this topic, but I do believe that your reply was driven by a complete breakdown of understanding between us, and so I had to explain the semantics of my post to remedy that.

Again, I am glad to disagree with you.

Itis important to recognize these hypocritical positions.

It isn't just the ""Only good women vote Democrat"" argument.

It is also ""Only real African Americans vote Democrat"".

""Only real Hispanics vote Democrat""

""Only real homosexuals vote Democrat"".

It's important to point this hypocritical thinking out because some people don't even see the hypocrisy. They actually believe the ""I am on the good guys team and they are all evil"" arguments.

It's basically the main theme behind the sidebar here in r/moderatepolitics - that this kind of thinking is not moderate at all.

In other words, for those of us who want to discuss strictly centrist policies and thoughts, r/neutralpolitics exists for us.

Personally, I believe that a key part of centrism means hearing what everyone has to say, not just from different political stances but also from different levels of education, rhetoric and argumentative quality, and that's extremely unlikely to be found in a place like r/neutralpolitics.

In other words, for those of us who want to discuss strictly centrist policies and thoughts, r/neutralpolitics exists for us. But in the same way that you're not going to find a liberal viewpoint on r/conservative or a men's rights viewpoint on r/twoxchromosomes, you're not going to find anyone who operates on emotion over logic, anyone with limited education or knowledge, and anyone who represents a truly radical position, even though all of these perspectives are potentially valuable and need to be discussed. I feel like that's what r/moderatepolitics could provide.

I don't think that's a fair generalization.  It would be akin to saying it's hard to believe anyone advocates central economic planning after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  (Obviously both situations are more nuanced than that.)

It'll take a while to understand the true impact of 2008 and, in the end, everybody isn't going to agree.   People who are less optimistic about the free market will look at it &amp; say it clearly demonstrated the problems of an open market, lack of regulation, etc.  People more favorable will point out banking is anything but a free market, given the already heavy regulation.

1. The formation of the crises as illustrated by numerous authers such as Michael Lewis in ""The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine"" nicely illustrates how some basic premises of libertarian economic theory are false. For example that people act rational. It's also a nice example of some forms of market failure. 

2. After the bubble became clear to some on Wall Street, they started to bet heavily against it. And when the bubble burst, those would have gone the way of Lehman Brothers. But when the guy you just loaned a couple billion dollars to in a bet you won by a factor of ten, you won't get those tens of billions of dollars, but you stand to loose your couple billion dollars. Citibank and AIG weren't bailed out, The winners were.","&gt; It's weird that Reddit is still so libertarian after 2008 and it's repercussions 

Let's talk about the 2008 crisis:

- The Fed actively blew up a housing bubble, which was at the start cheered on by people like Krugman. &lt;--- Government interference.

- The government guaranteed riskly loans and what amounted to no-loss gambling on Wall Street, as the government promised to bail out bad loans. &lt;--- Government interference.

- Back in 2004, Ron Paul, a strong free-market ally, said that the loans given to Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae would blow up, resulting in a credit crisis. He cited Austrian business cycle theory with regard to the cheap credit given by the Fed. &lt;--- Free-market person warns about crisis in great detail.

- After it became apparent that gross fraud had been commited, the government then prosecuted almost no one, and bailed out the corrupt companies ensuring that not only are the trouble makers not punished, but they get to keep their cushy six-figure jobs. &lt;--- government supporting those who fucked up.

Tell me again how 2008 was the fault of market forces, and why we need the government to interfere more....

Nobody understands economics. There are people that have theories. Most of them have some truth to it. But none of them come even close to what is really happening. It is way too complex. Basic free market theory, for example, has the premise that people are rational. But they are not. Which is one of the major problems. So you can't even explain what is happening. And even if they were rational, there are at least four completely independant ways of so called [market failure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure).

3698,"&gt; No one said markets are perfect, but to believe that interference by political motivated individuals into something so complex can effectively manage problems is pretty darn silly.

That would mean anarchy. 

You know one of the huge problems associated with the crisis over here in Germany was/is the failure of democracy. A lot of the actions were interpreted as not democratic. That politics lost their primacy to large companies, which started to make their own laws. The will of the people, democracy, lost and we slipped a little way into a kleptocracy more akin to China or Russia.

If the people stop holding absolute power, freedom will end. Which is actually an opposite position to libertarianism, IMHO. So a firm economic policy, with respect to a free and fair market, can be very libertarian. Instead of a blind believe that market forces are good or work. It's not only monopolies but also market failure (in multiple ways) that prevent that from happening.

The problem here is that motivational studies show that people don't work better for more profit.

I don't think you get the point I was trying to make. i'm not saying there isn't a such thing as rational. I'm just saying it's pointless to try and measure it scientifically. Rational isn't an objective term. Each person has their own idea of what it means. I think certain things are rational as I'm sure you do.

You say ""how can those people eat at that restaurant"" or ""don't they know that company is bad for the environment, why do they shop there"". 

&gt;Either way, you don't get the best result with a free market.

I am not trying to do that. 

&gt; as some sort of market failure

I have a strong feeling that you seem to disregard the concept of market failure, which has become pretty basic economics these days. It's about as proven as free market theory. As anything economic can be proven. Or not, as it turns out. 

&gt; company is bad for the environment

That would fall under external effects.

&gt; What does that even mean? Who get's to say what best even means? Just because you don't like the outcome, doesn't mean it's therefore objectively bad. 

That's an interesting thought. You see, I believe there is an objective better and worse. For example: If I can, right now, make €10 profit by killing a million people or a €5 profit by doing something that won't kill them, I believe one of them is objectively surperior. Unlimited free markets and a sociopath (which is pretty much what happened in 2008) beg to differ. And you can go less than my grossly overstated example to ""putting 10 tons of CO2 in the air"" vs. ""putting 2 tons of CO2 in the air"". I am just talking about external effects right now. Which is just one example of market failure. Completely independent of the others (like information asymmetry). Because there is not one market failure, but several. And my critic of unbound free markets doesn't stop with market failure. Though I am leaving proven economic ground in that. So I will leave it with market failure for now.

Sure they threaten regularly, but that's bluster that can be safely ignored. What does need to be considered is whether the leadership thinks the regime faces an existential threat. If they do, they will be more likely to escalate a situation that would otherwise be resolved without bloodshed.

You seem to think being ""concerned about their feelings"" is some sort of weakness. In reality, considering the motives and point of view of an adversary is helpful in containing or eventually diffusing a threat. It's how you form a strategy instead of just stumbling around the world stage waving a big loaded weapon.

The only source of meat for the civilians lucky enough to have them are dogs, which are farmed specifically for food. Much rarer, to the point of irrelevance, are pigs. Cows are forbidden from being eaten, because they produce more effective labor than people (because this is a country that still uses cows as agricultural equipment) and so killing a cow is a capital crime. Resources are so depleted that Best Korea must resort to illegally importing oil from China and Russia, and the food supply is spread so thin that widespread malnutrition has lead to the average Nork being 1 to 3 inches shorter than the average South Korean.

""please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button,""

&gt;Trump does indeed have a button on his desk, but it's a button that tells an attendant to bring him two diet cokes. Nuclear Launch protocols are much more complex, and the process is initiated by a phone call (He does, and we've confirmed this as well, have a phone at his desk.) So the ""Nuclear Button"" is a metaphor for the nuclear capability of each country, as we will see from the rest of the tweet.

""but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his,""

&gt;In regards to our nuclear arsenal, this is true. The maximum yield estimates of Best Korean nuclear tests have capped out at 250 kilotons of TNT (1,000 TJ), and the most liberal estimates as to their strategic arsenal are that they have at most, 60 deliverable nuclear warheads.

&gt;Compare that to the US, which has 6,800 nuclear and thermonuclear missiles, with yields of up to, and usually standardized at, 1.2 megatons of TNT (5020.8 TJ) (Note: We've made FAAAR more powerful thermonukes, we just also recognize the sweet spots of effectiveness for using them and the appropriate payloads)

&gt;Also true. North Korea has had numerous, high-publicity (from a Western media standpoint) test failures regarding their missile program.

In fact, no one seems to be paying attention to the fact that Trump's tweet is a RESPONSE to Kim Jong Un flippantly implying that he could nuke a major regional US ally, or the US proper, for that matter, and are instead treating Trump like this is a completely unwarranted declaration of intent to nuke Best Korea.

I disagree. There is plenty of public evidence available, and anyone paying attention knew about the Flynn phone call almost around the moment it happened.

Just a knee jerk example here, but since you're on reddit I hope it will resonate.

Look at the state of internet access in the United States. Our country literally invented the internet - we had *years* of a head start before anyone else had even begun to think of a concept, and yet right now we have one of the worst networks anywhere in the developed world.

Why is this? The answer is the same for any sort of telcom, from phone lines to wireless - and it's what you would probably deem compassion.

Because of the large geography of the US, telcoms have constantly been subsidized by our government. To the tune of not billions, but trillions of dollars just in our last major stimulus packages.

In the case of ISP's especially, the government socializes itself in another way. It forms *and protects* regional monopolies. The reasons for this policy is the same as those for a stimulus.

So the government eliminates competition, and also subsidizes the infrastructure of huge ISPs (almost *never* passing any money to the few local ISP's that manage to muscle their way into a municipality).

This is a mix of ""capitalism and socialism"", and it drives me mad because it's the worst sort collusion you can imagine. We ask government to both control and support corporations, and we wonder why it can't seem to do both.

- Subsidized College loans.  Ostensibly this is like a mini-GI bill, broad based, to encourage people of lesser means to get a college education.  We say that the world is information driven, that people will have a better chance to participate as productive citizens, if they are educated. Beyond which, a liberal education means a more stable populace, a more civil society. All good right?  

But then they made college loans untouchable in bankruptcy.  This means college loans are worth more than any other loan.  Not all loans are created equal. College tuition loans are untouchable, immortal.  In its wisdom the law allows crushing debt to be dispensed via bankruptcy, but not college loans.  And the logical consequence of that is that the cost of college will skyrocket. College costs go up, because of the economic law of subsidy: subsidizing anything makes it more expensive. The loans themselves are a subsidy, but the fact that they are not dismissable in bankrupcty is an extraordinary subsidy.  

- Subsidized corn. Sure, we need a secure food supply. But is the best way to do that, handing out billions of dollars to Monsanto and other mega corporations? Honestly? We subsidized corn ethanol for 30 years, when as long as 20 years ago it became very clear that the economics were upside down. And yet the congress continued handing out money. 

- Obama's Healthcare reform. What people really need is quality healthcare for a reasonable cost, but because of corporate influence in the congress, we got a system that essentially continues the status quo, and is not funded to deliver the benefits we wanted. 

- Bush's Medicare Prescription Drug benefit. A giant giveaway to old people in exchange for votes. We couldn't afford this when it was proposed, and we still can't.

- Iraq. Sure, we want global security, but invading a country and destroying all the infrastructure?  Essentially we paid people to blow crap up, then paid the same people to rebuild it.  The US military excursion into Iraq, aside from all the deaths of innocent people, has been a huge boondoggle for defense contractors and military consultants, Iraq is what President Eisenhower apochryphally warned us about when he decried the ""military industrial complex"" in his farewell address.

3934,"&gt;the economic law of subsidy: subsidizing anything makes it more expensive

Wait, really? I thought subsidies were supposed to make prices go down for consumers.

Damn, economics, you scary.","yes really.

Subsidies are a form of market interference.  Sometimes they lower the cost to consumers. Sometimes they raise the cost to consumers.  Sometimes they are neutral to consumers.  But in all cases, subsidy raises the *net cost* for the subsidized good.  When I use the term subsidy, it refers to any kind of subsidy.

One form of subsidy is a tariff. For example, there's a tax on sugar imported from Brazil to the USA.  For real.  For every 100 lbs of sugar, the US government charges the importer, let's say, $10.  I don't know the actual number, but I know there's a real subsidy. Using our fake number, it means the seller/importer has to charge $10 more for that 100lbs of sugar, to make the same profit. In other words the tariff increases the net cost of the imported sugar. 

This is a form of subsidy for sugar produced domestically, in the USA.  Obviously this form of subsidy does not make sugar cheaper for consumers, right?  It makes imported sugar more expensive, and it thus allows domestic sugar to be priced higher, because it does not need to compete with the naturally cheaper imported sugar. So the effect of this subsidy is to make all sugar (imported as well as domestic) more expensive for everyone. 

Another form of subsidy is government assistance for purchases.  Think of subsidized government housing, available to lower-income people. If a person takes advantage of that subsidized housing, *they pay less for housing* than they might otherwise. On the other hand, the net cost of the housing goes up.  That's because the total cost is what the consumer pays, plus what the government pays.  The owner of the subsidized housing gets more money for the rental unit than he would in a completely free market, for the same property.  The full net cost of the subsidized good (rental housing) is not transmitted to the direct consumer; instead the extra cost is picked up by the taxpayer. Some portion of their taxes goes to paying the higher cost of the subsidized rent. net cost: up.  consumer cost: down. 

Another kind of subsidy is cheap money - subsidized loans that can be used only for particular purposes. FNMA and FMAC did this for housing loans.  The federally-supported school loans do this for college tuition.  The effect is that the ""cost of money"" to be used for a particular purpose is lower than it otherwise would be. One effect is that the thing being purchased is more accessible - more people can buy a house, or more people can go to college. But, another effect is that the cost of the thing being purchased with cheaper money - the house or the college tuition - goes up. There is more money chasing the same resource - houses or admission spots at Stanford - so the price of that good naturally goes up.  

Government-subsidized school loans allow more people to go to college, but the net cost of a college education goes up, as compared to a hypothetical free market, in which there are no govt-supported loans available. 

The other subsidy affecting college tuition loans is their exclusion from dismissal in bankruptcy.  That is a huge subsidy, which makes the book value of the loan much, much higher than it would be. Think of it this way: people default on some percentage of loans .  For argument's sake, let's say 1% of loans don't get paid back. This is a risk to lenders, and they use this credit default rate to figure the interest to charge for all loans.  The interest has to be enough to make up for expected losses from loan defaults. 

But the default rate for school loans is by law, 0%.  You cannot default. You cannot ever dismiss the loan.  So that means a loan of $10,000 for school tuition, is worth a lot more to a bank, than a loan of $10,000, in the form of a credit card balance, which can be dismissed in bankruptcy.  The fact that the loans never default encourages more lending for school loans; according to supply and demand, more school loan money pushes the cost of tuition up.

Another form of subsidy - government payouts for particular things. Funny story: at one time the US Government established a policy to eliminate wolves from Yellowstone National Park. So what did they do?  They offered $10 per head of each wolf killed. Bring in a wolf head, get $10.  Bring in ten heads, get $100.  Guess what happened?  The population of wolves in the park skyrocketed.  Why?  Because what used to be worthless - the head of a dead wolf - was now worth $10.  This can be thought of as a direct subsidy for wolf heads.  Obviously the cost for wolf heads went up - from zero to $10.  And incidentally, because of the increased value (or price) of wolf heads, people began to raise wolves for profit, which means the population of wolves went up.  Oops.

**TL;DR**: Subsidy for a thing always increases the net cost of a thing, though that cost may not be passed directly to the consumer of the thing.  

- In the particular case of government-subsidized school loans, the effect is to increase the cost of a college education *for everyone,* whether they use a government-subsidized loan to pay for college or not. 

- In the particular case of subsidized home loans, the cost of a house goes up for everyone.  

- In the case of sugar tariffs, the cost of sugar goes up for everyone.  

- In the case of subsidized low-income rental housing, the cost of housing goes down for the consumer of the subsidized housing, and up for everyone else (via taxes).

3935,"yes really.

Subsidies are a form of market interference.  Sometimes they lower the cost to consumers. Sometimes they raise the cost to consumers.  Sometimes they are neutral to consumers.  But in all cases, subsidy raises the *net cost* for the subsidized good.  When I use the term subsidy, it refers to any kind of subsidy.

One form of subsidy is a tariff. For example, there's a tax on sugar imported from Brazil to the USA.  For real.  For every 100 lbs of sugar, the US government charges the importer, let's say, $10.  I don't know the actual number, but I know there's a real subsidy. Using our fake number, it means the seller/importer has to charge $10 more for that 100lbs of sugar, to make the same profit. In other words the tariff increases the net cost of the imported sugar. 

This is a form of subsidy for sugar produced domestically, in the USA.  Obviously this form of subsidy does not make sugar cheaper for consumers, right?  It makes imported sugar more expensive, and it thus allows domestic sugar to be priced higher, because it does not need to compete with the naturally cheaper imported sugar. So the effect of this subsidy is to make all sugar (imported as well as domestic) more expensive for everyone. 

Another form of subsidy is government assistance for purchases.  Think of subsidized government housing, available to lower-income people. If a person takes advantage of that subsidized housing, *they pay less for housing* than they might otherwise. On the other hand, the net cost of the housing goes up.  That's because the total cost is what the consumer pays, plus what the government pays.  The owner of the subsidized housing gets more money for the rental unit than he would in a completely free market, for the same property.  The full net cost of the subsidized good (rental housing) is not transmitted to the direct consumer; instead the extra cost is picked up by the taxpayer. Some portion of their taxes goes to paying the higher cost of the subsidized rent. net cost: up.  consumer cost: down. 

Another kind of subsidy is cheap money - subsidized loans that can be used only for particular purposes. FNMA and FMAC did this for housing loans.  The federally-supported school loans do this for college tuition.  The effect is that the ""cost of money"" to be used for a particular purpose is lower than it otherwise would be. One effect is that the thing being purchased is more accessible - more people can buy a house, or more people can go to college. But, another effect is that the cost of the thing being purchased with cheaper money - the house or the college tuition - goes up. There is more money chasing the same resource - houses or admission spots at Stanford - so the price of that good naturally goes up.  

Government-subsidized school loans allow more people to go to college, but the net cost of a college education goes up, as compared to a hypothetical free market, in which there are no govt-supported loans available. 

The other subsidy affecting college tuition loans is their exclusion from dismissal in bankruptcy.  That is a huge subsidy, which makes the book value of the loan much, much higher than it would be. Think of it this way: people default on some percentage of loans .  For argument's sake, let's say 1% of loans don't get paid back.

3940,"I personally think it has a lot to do with the connotation people simply have in their heads with the words they hear, and being a liberal has been denigrated for quite some time and even the liberals and progressives tend to shy away from being called such.

There's certainly plenty of distrust in the government and liberals are the de facto supporters of an active, robust government role in society, but when the framing of these basic terms such as conservative and liberal are established as almost being good and bad, realistic and naive, productive vs consumptive, people will naturally identify themselves as being the more positively identified term.  

I've also noticed it can be more difficult to articulate an effective point for liberal or progressive ideals or values, as they seem to stem from results of a purely values-based system of operation, seeking to correct a problem from the current status quo.  So there's layers to being able to communicate this message effectively to people who might not be thinking about it, such as first establishing a common value or system that is agreed upon.  Then move onto a potential pitfall of having such a simplistic view of that system, perhaps a method of exploiting it.  State how a mechanism might work to prevent or mitigate the damage done by this corruption of the system, and that a purely voluntary basis of participation of those operating in this system is not workable(such as those people not participating in this preventive measure are at a competitive advantage to those participating), and that therefore a law or policy must be established to either encourage or compel entities to adhere to this preventive measure.  State this is a possible approach to progressive/liberal thought and query how that is evil or stupid, and ask for input on how to prevent that being corrupted somehow.","&gt;being a liberal has been denigrated for quite some time and even the liberals and progressives tend to shy away from being called such

This is true, and I wonder how it became this way so easily. I believe that there is a slightly leftist bias in media (because it's a field that traditionally requires more education), so it's curious that the term ""liberal"" has such a negative connotation.

&gt;as they seem to stem from results of a purely values-based system of operation

I don't think this is necessarily a fair assessment of liberal vs. conservative ideas. I think most genuine political opinions stem from value systems, but when you get down to the bone of an argument sometimes it's the ONLY difference. For example, we *know* that socially and statistically, abortions are a ""good thing"". They result lower crime, give a safer environment for abortions that would happen anyway, and have the potential to save the lives of mothers with pregnancy complications. Why then, is there opposition to abortion? It's because some people value human life - even at an illogical stage of its existence - enough to ignore facts. My own discomfort with the morality of abortion stems from things other than its proven viability to society.

There's a difference between the freedom to abort a fetus, and establishing policies that demand participation by force. To defeat a law against abortion, all I have to do is prove that someone should be free to make a decision. To create a powerful (if not efficient) social safety net, I must not only demonstrate that it will be effective, but I must also compel someone who gains much less from a measure to support it with their livelihood. Those are the ""layers"" you're talking about, not the idea that only liberals have a correct sense of morality.",45,57,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics
3942,"I agree that I probably glossed over some in my description of the two general directions of ideas in liberals and conservatives, though I disagree that all one has to do to defeat a law against abortion, for example, is to demonstrate it's effectiveness.  Besides the most fundamental view of thinking it shouldn't be allowed on the basis of it being immoral, the sometimes implied and sometimes outright idea of there being women who have multitudes of abortions underscores an idea that proponents of abortion are reckless in their sexual habits and are deferring their responsibility to both their baby as well as the state, costing both of those entities while enabling the woman who got the abortion to go out and continue behaving in the way they have been.  Especially in areas that identify very strongly with traditional values, these chip away and distract from the realities that those getting the procedure may very well not be in a financial or otherwise position to properly raise a child, may not be healthy enough to carry to term, or the oft-touted examples, while hopefully very rare in the overall number of abortions, rape victims.

On the hand, a social safety net could theoretically be proven with simply appealing to one's sense of equitability and charity if it is done in a way that appeals to the listener, but this is unlikely given the complexities of that argument as well.

I didn't mean to imply that only liberals have a correct sense of morality, and I apologize if it came off as high-handed or elitist because saying only one 'side' has a correct sense of morality is, indeed, a way of demonstrating some level of arrogance in one's own position.  What I meant to say in the progression part of my post was simply to engage with someone of a differing position so as to establish some common points of agreement and then to discuss how those commonalities break down on other points of discussion.  It very well may not, and probably won't lead to someone changing their opinion on things, but what it more likely can do will at least expose this person to a differing point of view in a way that is less offensive than having that same opinion misrepresented or caricatured by a person who actually doesn't even hold that opinion(such as, say, individuals like Glenn Beck or Sean Hannity presuming to speak for the values, motivations and goals of liberals or Keith Olbermann and Ed Schultz stating they know what lies in the hearts of conservatives).  Having an honest, nonaggressive exchange of ideas will better serve the participants than an increasingly tense atmosphere of arguing and attempting to establish superiority of morality or facts(which often can be taken out of context to be leveraged to one end or another).  It also, to me, fosters the sort of civil exchange of ideas, even if and especially if those involved don't come to agreement because a tenant of our representative systems is that we decide our current events and political disagreements with one another, not by ignoring and demonizing one another.  If it were not so, then why even establish a system which, at base, deals with having to contend with individuals of differing opinions?","&gt;I believe that there is a slightly leftist bias in media (**because it's a field that traditionally requires more education)**, so it's curious that the term ""liberal"" has such a negative connotation.

3951,"&gt;A) this is correlational evidence, not causational. This distinction is very important.

I agree but I am unclear as to what you think this means. Does this mean we cannot use these studies to make an informed decision on gun control? Does this mean that the studies are correct but all it tell us is that these two things occurred at the same time and they have no or a very small relationship?

&gt;B) Even by proving the point of ""more guns do not stop more crimes"", this does not prove or give any real evidence to ""less guns do stop more crimes"", just anecdotal, correlational evidence.

The articles discuss studies that suggest that homes with guns had an increased risk of violence and suicide. I don't think it proves that fewer guns stop crime but that if you are around a gun the chances of being involved a crime that includes death increases.

&gt;The belief that more guns lead to fewer crimes is founded on the idea that guns are dangerous when bad guys have them, so we should get more guns into the hands of good guys. Yet Cook, the Duke economist, says this good guy/bad guy dichotomy is a false and dangerous one. Even upstanding American citizens are only human—they can “lose their temper, or exercise poor judgment, or misinterpret a situation, or have a few drinks,” he explains, and if they're carrying guns when they do, bad things can ensue. In 2013 in Ionia, Mich., a road rage incident led two drivers—both concealed carry permit holders—to get out of their cars, take out their guns and kill each other.

What did you think of this claim made in the article? Does the mix of accessible guns and alcohol/drugs play a role in these numbers? If we remove all the people who were high/drunk when they committed violent acts with guns do you think it would show that sober people make good choice with weapons even when they get emotionally upset?

&gt;And regardless of either of those points, if your goal is to stop crimes, and you believe getting rid of guns will help this, how will you make the population of Americans who want to have guns give them up? Will you perhaps advocate the use of force by police officers carrying guns?

&gt;And regardless of either of those points, if your goal is to stop crimes, and you believe getting rid of guns will help this, 

I don't think the suggestion is that we need to get rid of all guns. I think we need to have a honest discussion about who should have access to guns (all of the varieties available) and what types of modifications we should allow to be legal. I think we need a way to ensure those who have shown signs of recent mental issues cannot purchase military style firearms and maybe have to get permission from a guardian to be able to purchase other weapons. I don't really have all the answers on this issue but I think there is a path forward that enables most people to be able to legally purchase most weapons and still restrict those who have demonstrated unstable, criminal or terrorist behavior should be denied or have to wait much longer.

&gt;how will you make the population of Americans who want to have guns give them up? Will you perhaps advocate the use of force by police officers carrying guns?

This just seems alarmist to me. I have not heard anyone suggest that we need to force responsible gun owners to give up their legally owned weapons. I am sure that are some politicians out there that is saying this and I disagree with them. In my view the discussion is more about those who are abusing their right to own weapons than those who do it responsibly. We need to be discussing how to make it harder for some people without making it overly burdensome for majority of responsible gun owners out there. 

edit: grammar 
","In the event of trying to totally ban guns- I'd say deal with the already existing ones through buybacks and just wait it out. Over time with new guns being harder to get the number of total guns will go down. Many old guns will become unusable, not be maintained properly, be lost, be destroyed purposely by criminals b/c they are evidence or by law enforcement when they are discovered in a crime. Over time more will be sold as gun collections are passed on to people who would rather take some money, so as long as buybacks buy some of those guns for sale, and as long as laws make it so that getting a gun is prohibitively expensive and time consuming, the amount of guns will reduce over time without having to harass people with cops at every door.",2343,3,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics

This is categorically [not true](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-guns-in-home-increase-suicide-homicide-risk/). There is a reason why people choose guns for suicide, because the effect is instant, your body can't simply throw up a bullet, and it is much more immediate which means you have less chance to second-guess yourself. When you bring a gun into your home, it increases the risk of someone dying, *including yourself*.
&gt;So the gun murder per capita rate has significantly decreased over that 20 year period from 3.93 per 100,000 to 3.4 in 2016 (2.99 in 2015 the year in the article).

As all crime has decreased in the last 20 years, we would expect the gun numbers to go down. Instead, they have lagged behind the fall of other crimes' numbers, which is the point.
&gt;The Florida spree shooter was reported to 3 different government agencies before he attacked. The government systems in place failed miserably so how do more laws and more government help?

The laws failed because of people unwilling to enforce them. You think a young black male convicted on a minimum sentence of carrying marijuana gets the same leniency as a middle aged white guy buying a gun? People just assume it isn't a big deal, even though categorically and unequivocally white men commit the overwhelming amount of mass shooting incidents in this country, while black and white men consume relatively equal amounts of marijuana.
&gt;If a person has made their mind up to commit murder making it slightly harder to buy a gun won't stop them.

I mean if you can tell me how someone can sit up in a hotel half a mile away and snipe people with a van or knife I'm all ears.","&gt;Current and proposed bans on ""assault rifles"" and magazine capacity are useless.

I disagree with this assertion that they are useless. Can you please explain why you think this to be the case?

&gt;I am all for background checks on secondary transfers as is most of our country. The article quoted 85% of Americans. However, all spree shooter legally passed a back ground check or stole their gun from family. This will not reduce spree shooters.

I think that background checks can and probably do help reduce spree shootings. I do not think the current system is perfect but I think it stops some people. 

&gt;I am for a mental health disqualification from owning firearms but it must be a court mandated appearance not tried in abstention like the no fly list. Additionally this will require massive revisions of our health care and rights to privacy laws, including HIPPA.

I don't think disqualification is the right answer, I just think it should be harder. Maybe if you have had a mental health problem in the last 6 months you have to wait an additional 30 days or have a guardian sign off on the purchase. If you think the standard should be court mandated appearance then I think this would be a meaningless to stopping people. I guess the problem here is that if the bar is too low you stop to many people, but if you make it too hard then very few of the afflicted people will every get this certification so it will have little to no impact.

&gt;&gt;""Guns took more than 36,000 U.S. lives in 2015, and this and other alarming statistics have led many to ask whether our nation would be better off with firearms in fewer hands. ""

&gt;Only 9,616 were murders the rest were mostly suicides with a few accidents. Source FBI Expanded Homicide Data Table 8. That is some misleading shit. 

In my view this conversation is not strictly about murders. The way I see it, when someone with mental health problems kills themselves or other people I think we should ask the question: Should we have let them purchase the weapon? If remove all the suicides from our discussion then we restrict our ability to try and stop a large number of deaths from occurring. 

&gt;Suicidal people are still going to kill them selves or attempt to with or with out a gun.

I don't believe this to be true, at least all of the time.

&gt; I have a major problem with this opening statistic, as suicides and murders should be looked at very differently.

I don't disagree that it would be useful to look at these things separately but nothing about including them together diminishes the information or conclusions presented in this article. 

&gt;I find it interesting the article doesn't quote gun murder statistics. Between 1997 to 2016 (as far as FBI statistics are listed online) total gun murders have ranged from 8,454 to 11,004. They don't follow a general pattern rising and falling several times in that 20 year period. However population of the US has greatly increased in that time, 272 million in 1997 to 323 million in 2016. So the gun murder per capita rate has significantly decreased over that 20 year period from 3.93 per 100,000 to 3.4 in 2016 (2.99 in 2015 the year in the article). Additionally, the number of firearms owned by private citizens has greatly increased during this time. NICS back ground checks for purchases of new firearms have gone from 9,138,123 in 1999 (earliest year listed online) to 27,538,673 in 2017. So there are more guns than ever before, higher population than ever before, but your chance of being murdered by a gun is decreasing steadily.

I think you want this article to be more narrowly focused then it actually is. I don't think think makes this article wrong or deceptive. I am going to assume that all of your numbers are correct. What do these numbers tell us about how to stop spree shootings in the US?

&gt;So I believe that this article intentionally misleads the reader in to assuming gun violence is growing, when gun murders per capita is shrinking. And this article seeks to conflate gun deaths (36,000 in 2015) with gun homicides (9,616 in 2015).

I don't think the author of the article claims that gun violence is growing in general. The article says:

&gt;But even as the belief that we are all future crime targets has taken hold, violent crime rates have actually dropped in the U.S. in recent decades. According to the FBI, rates were a whopping 41 percent lower in 2015 than they were in 1996. The NRA attributes this decrease to the acquisition of more guns. But that is misleading. What has increased is the number of people who own multiple guns—the actual number of people and households who own them has substantially dropped.

So the article acknowledges that violent crime rates have dropped in the US. It does suggest, as shown below, that states that have tried to make it easier for people to use their weapons in self deference have had increases in their homicide rates.

&gt;Recently researchers have tried to assess the value of self-defense gun use by studying “stand your ground” laws, which gained notoriety after teenager Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012. These laws allow people to kill in self-defense when they feel they are in danger. Progun groups argue that they should deter crime because criminals will know that victims have no reason not to fight back. But a January 2017 study reported that when “stand your ground” was passed in Florida, the monthly homicide rate went up by nearly a quarter. And a 2012 study found that states that adopted these laws experienced an abrupt and sustained 8 percent increase in homicides relative to other states. Mark Hoekstra, a co-author of the 2012 paper and an economist at Texas A&amp;M University, put it this way: “We found that making it easier to kill people resulted in more dead people.”

&gt;And a 2012 study found that states that adopted these laws experienced an abrupt and sustained 8 percent increase in homicides relative to other states. Mark Hoekstra, a co-author of the 2012 paper and an economist at Texas A&amp;M University, put it this way: “We found that making it easier to kill people resulted in more dead people.”

So the article claims that certain states have seen increases their in homicides after changing their laws to allow for more freedom to use weapons to in self defense, but on a national level violent crime has dropped.

&gt;The second part being very important because we have many laws that aren't currently enforced and safety protocols that aren't followed. The Florida spree shooter was reported to 3 different government agencies before he attacked. The government systems in place failed miserably so how do more laws and more government help?

I have heard this claim but I really don't know what this means. What laws are not being enforced and why are we not enforcing them? 

I think the questions should be how effective is our current system at stopping the sale of guns to people who have shown signs of intent to commit suicide or homicide. Can we stop more of these people while at the same time not stop people who have no such problems?

This is never going to be a perfect system that stops everyone all the time. If we can improve it to stop just a few more people then I think it is worth it.


&gt;If a person has made their mind up to commit murder making it slightly harder to buy a gun won't stop them. 

There is no such thing as a perfect system that stops every bad person but approves every good person. I just think we can improve on the system we have a bit. Realistically many people steal or own weapons prior to becoming mentally unstable. These rules won[t stop those people. I don't think this means we should not talk about improvements to the current system.

&gt;TL:DR We can discuss useful policy but this article conflates and misrepresents multiple issues involving firearms.

I think this article is broadly focused on guns and violence. I agree it could use better sourcing but I don't think is misrepresents or conflates the issues of murder and all gun violence. I would be open to continuing this discussion with another article of your choice. Maybe you can find one that is a bit more focus on the issue of murders rather than all gun violence. I do think that when we talk about changing the laws to restrict purchase to people with demonstrated signs of mental issues that we should include suicides in the discussion. 

",2343,7,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics
3956,"&gt;Current and proposed bans on ""assault rifles"" and magazine capacity are useless.

I disagree with this assertion that they are useless. Can you please explain why you think this to be the case?

&gt;I am all for background checks on secondary transfers as is most of our country. The article quoted 85% of Americans. However, all spree shooter legally passed a back ground check or stole their gun from family. This will not reduce spree shooters.

I think that background checks can and probably do help reduce spree shootings. I do not think the current system is perfect but I think it stops some people. 

&gt;I am for a mental health disqualification from owning firearms but it must be a court mandated appearance not tried in abstention like the no fly list. Additionally this will require massive revisions of our health care and rights to privacy laws, including HIPPA.

I don't think disqualification is the right answer, I just think it should be harder. Maybe if you have had a mental health problem in the last 6 months you have to wait an additional 30 days or have a guardian sign off on the purchase. If you think the standard should be court mandated appearance then I think this would be a meaningless to stopping people. I guess the problem here is that if the bar is too low you stop to many people, but if you make it too hard then very few of the afflicted people will every get this certification so it will have little to no impact.

&gt;&gt;""Guns took more than 36,000 U.S. lives in 2015, and this and other alarming statistics have led many to ask whether our nation would be better off with firearms in fewer hands. ""

&gt;Only 9,616 were murders the rest were mostly suicides with a few accidents. Source FBI Expanded Homicide Data Table 8. That is some misleading shit. 

In my view this conversation is not strictly about murders. The way I see it, when someone with mental health problems kills themselves or other people I think we should ask the question: Should we have let them purchase the weapon? If remove all the suicides from our discussion then we restrict our ability to try and stop a large number of deaths from occurring. 

&gt;Suicidal people are still going to kill them selves or attempt to with or with out a gun.

I don't believe this to be true, at least all of the time.

&gt; I have a major problem with this opening statistic, as suicides and murders should be looked at very differently.

I don't disagree that it would be useful to look at these things separately but nothing about including them together diminishes the information or conclusions presented in this article. 

&gt;I find it interesting the article doesn't quote gun murder statistics. Between 1997 to 2016 (as far as FBI statistics are listed online) total gun murders have ranged from 8,454 to 11,004. They don't follow a general pattern rising and falling several times in that 20 year period. However population of the US has greatly increased in that time, 272 million in 1997 to 323 million in 2016. So the gun murder per capita rate has significantly decreased over that 20 year period from 3.93 per 100,000 to 3.4 in 2016 (2.99 in 2015 the year in the article). Additionally, the number of firearms owned by private citizens has greatly increased during this time. NICS back ground checks for purchases of new firearms have gone from 9,138,123 in 1999 (earliest year listed online) to 27,538,673 in 2017. So there are more guns than ever before, higher population than ever before, but your chance of being murdered by a gun is decreasing steadily.

I think you want this article to be more narrowly focused then it actually is. I don't think think makes this article wrong or deceptive. I am going to assume that all of your numbers are correct. What do these numbers tell us about how to stop spree shootings in the US?

&gt;So I believe that this article intentionally misleads the reader in to assuming gun violence is growing, when gun murders per capita is shrinking. And this article seeks to conflate gun deaths (36,000 in 2015) with gun homicides (9,616 in 2015).

I don't think the author of the article claims that gun violence is growing in general. The article says:

&gt;But even as the belief that we are all future crime targets has taken hold, violent crime rates have actually dropped in the U.S. in recent decades. According to the FBI, rates were a whopping 41 percent lower in 2015 than they were in 1996. The NRA attributes this decrease to the acquisition of more guns. But that is misleading. What has increased is the number of people who own multiple guns—the actual number of people and households who own them has substantially dropped.

So the article acknowledges that violent crime rates have dropped in the US. It does suggest, as shown below, that states that have tried to make it easier for people to use their weapons in self deference have had increases in their homicide rates.

&gt;Recently researchers have tried to assess the value of self-defense gun use by studying “stand your ground” laws, which gained notoriety after teenager Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012. These laws allow people to kill in self-defense when they feel they are in danger. Progun groups argue that they should deter crime because criminals will know that victims have no reason not to fight back. But a January 2017 study reported that when “stand your ground” was passed in Florida, the monthly homicide rate went up by nearly a quarter. And a 2012 study found that states that adopted these laws experienced an abrupt and sustained 8 percent increase in homicides relative to other states. Mark Hoekstra, a co-author of the 2012 paper and an economist at Texas A&amp;M University, put it this way: “We found that making it easier to kill people resulted in more dead people.”

&gt;And a 2012 study found that states that adopted these laws experienced an abrupt and sustained 8 percent increase in homicides relative to other states. Mark Hoekstra, a co-author of the 2012 paper and an economist at Texas A&amp;M University, put it this way: “We found that making it easier to kill people resulted in more dead people.”

So the article claims that certain states have seen increases their in homicides after changing their laws to allow for more freedom to use weapons to in self defense, but on a national level violent crime has dropped.

&gt;The second part being very important because we have many laws that aren't currently enforced and safety protocols that aren't followed. The Florida spree shooter was reported to 3 different government agencies before he attacked. The government systems in place failed miserably so how do more laws and more government help?

I have heard this claim but I really don't know what this means. What laws are not being enforced and why are we not enforcing them? 

I think the questions should be how effective is our current system at stopping the sale of guns to people who have shown signs of intent to commit suicide or homicide. Can we stop more of these people while at the same time not stop people who have no such problems?

This is never going to be a perfect system that stops everyone all the time. If we can improve it to stop just a few more people then I think it is worth it.


&gt;If a person has made their mind up to commit murder making it slightly harder to buy a gun won't stop them.

If these provisions cut the number of return visits to the ER by even a modest amount, the savings could be HUGE.  Only time will tell if they are, but this kind of push for better care and less re-admissions is just one of many provisions in the law aiming to reign in spending.  

Before this provision, there was no disincentive to shoddy care that could land an elderly person back in the ER next week (beyond the hippocratic oath).  In fact, when the patient came back, they'd give them sloppy care and bill Medicare again, so having them back a week later would mean more money for the hospital.  

Example: I understand that doctors don't want to do time consuming procedures knowing that they won't be paid well by Medicare, but if the hospital they work for gets dinged when they don't, hopefully the decision to take shitty pay for an hour versus giving the patient a pill and rushing them out will be an easier one for the docs.

&gt; a story the mainstream media and liberals may not want you to see

Are you sure this kind of story belongs in /r/moderatepolitics? This isn't even about politics. This is a sad story about a single person (which has nothing to do with politics, btw.) used to somehow smear ""liberals"" or ""main stream media"". Which is clearly bogus, as the main stream media was all over the ""bad part"" of the riots and denounced them strongly while completely ignoring any kind of peaceful protest. Because media needs to sell, and most people want drama. Peaceful doesn't sell.

A liberal would probabely respond with ""single payer universal healthcare would provide the child with everything and replace it in case of fire"". 

So the attacks both on ""liberals"" and ""main stream media"" are misplaced. I think this is a clear logical fallacy. 

And even if you would disagree with all of that, which is perfectly fine, this is a civil place, I think everyone can agree that this is a very partisan story from story from an extremely partisan source.

So I think the best example of Fake News was that time that every reputable news outlet in the country promised us that Michael Flynn was going to testify that Trump ordered him to talk to Russia during the election and discuss sanctions and how to win the election and thereby prove the collusion story to be true....

Spent an entire friday telling me this. promising me this.

Only to find out that he pleaded to talking to a Russian ambassador 2 months after the election about Obama's last minute tantrum sanctions that he placed as he walked out the door.

Another time was when they promised me just after the election that computer experts determined the voting machines in every state that voted for Obama and then for Trump were hacked! It was just after the election, thanksgiving, and they even did recounts because of the computer models some dude at a college made. A dude that didn't even work on the election or for the government.

It did seem as if they just made shit up out of thin air...

But really, what they did is go off the unnamed sources word that a unnamed source said it was true.

9 times out of 10, this is the ""Fake News"" source. ""Unnamed Sources"" or ""Sources Say"".

This behavior is literally as old as the printing press. Older. As old as the sowing circle.

So if a person is unable to figure out on their own how www.realfuckingnews.com is not reputable... well... there is a reason why so half of all people are below the average intellect. It's a muscle. They can work on it and learn and get better.

To be more specific, Puerto Rico is an **unincorporated** U.S. territory, but residents do not get to vote for president. They do elect a **non-voting** delegate to the House of Representatives.

&gt; Additionally, all persons born in Puerto Rico on or after January 13, 1941, are native-born citizens of Puerto Rico, but only naturalized citizens at birth of the United States.

This mess is the result of the US wanting to enter WWI.  They needed a source of canon fodder that wouldn't make the war unpopular or cost votes.  So Congress gave Puerto Ricans the minimum possible definition of citizenship - without consulting them - so that they could be drafted and sent off to the trenches.  No votes lost.

The issue has evolved to the point where Puerto Ricans are [almost eligible](http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2013/03/puerto-ricanborn-congressman-questions-supreme-court-159343.html).  That is, it's another being evaded rather than answered.  It'll probably have to be addressed by the Supreme Court.

An April 2000 report by the Congressional Research Service, asserted that citizens born in Puerto Rico are legally defined as natural born citizens and are therefore eligible to be elected President, provided they meet qualifications of age and 14 years residence within the United States.

However, according to this report, residence in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories and possessions does not qualify as residence within the United States for these purposes.  So any successful politician in Puerto Rico would have to drop out of Puerto Rican politics for 14 years, living in the US to run for President.

I'm using this as a debate proposal and would like to see what con arguments (or extra pro research) people have to offer, so any contributions, positive or negative, are greatly appreciated.","There are a lot of reasons, but there are two main ones in my mind.

The first one is that liability doesn't cure patients who are treated incorrectly.  I recently saw a patient who had seen a NP at a walk in clinic for an irritated eye.  The NP wasn't able to find any foreign body or any other source of the inflammation so she referred the patient to an ophthalmologist and gave him some steroid eye drops in the interim.  Initially the patient's eye felt better due to the drops so they skipped the ophthalmologist appt.  About 1 week later the patient presented to the ED with a *severely* infected cornea.  As it turns out, the patient originally had a mild herpes simplex infection of his eye, but the immunosuppressing steroid drops let it run completely amok and he'll likely be virtually blind in that eye until he gets a corneal transplant.

The other reason that sticks out in my mind is a bit more biased, but I believe there is data to back it up.  At the moment, NPs and PAs tend to order quite a few more unnecessary tests than physicians.  With that in mind, it seems likely that, give the ability to prescribe medications, they will probably be much more likely to prescribe things like antibiotics, and more likely to use ""heavier hitting"" antibiotics.

4108,Devil's Advocate - What groups attract more of a percentage of active terrorists?,"Red Herring.

Terrorism isn't really a religious issue, religion just happens to be the justification du jour.  The vast majority of people who actually commit terrorist acts (as opposed to people who use terrorist rhetoric) are poor people who lack realistic opportunities for meeting their basic needs, or who have been victimized by institutionalized violence.

Also, as I said elsewhere, what constitutes terrorism is incredibly controversial and it often depends on whose side you're on.

What's more, Islamic terrorism has it's roots in US CIA operations.  In the 1980's when the mujahideen were fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, the US funneled billions of dollars through Pakistan ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone)), and President Reagan called them ""freedom fighters"" ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen#US.2C_Pakistani_and_other_financing_and_support)).  Beginning with President Carter's national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski was explicitly aimed at increasing Islamic fanaticism in Central Asia to destabilize the Soviet Union.  Without the US' efforts, it's entirely possible that international Islamist terrorist groups would never have been able to form, because they grew out of US funded, US trained ""contra"" operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Simply put, Islamic terrorism was manufactured, and once begun, it became impossible to control.

So arguing that Islam produces terrorists is misguided because it ignores that Islamic Arab countries are disproportionately likely to be dealing with a military occupation, or dictatorship both of which are apt to produce terrorism.  Since the US, its interests and allies are the targets of much of those actions, it's easy for us to see it as ""terrorist"" instead of as ""freedom fighters"" like we did 30 years ago when the same sort of people were engaged in the same sort of behavior.  Many of the terror groups that so haunt the American psyche today were either explicitly created by the CIA in the 80's, or they grew out of the relationships and networks those operations forged.",1318,9,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics

This will inevitably draw a few bigots who support getting the government out of these things primarily because they feel that it would be a way to attack their race-war enemy.  

Is that the fault of the people who support those positions for legitimate non-racist reasons?  Is there some way for the legitimate people to police the type of people who agree with them?  I have never heard of one, especially since the tea party is so decentralized.  How do things change if we apply the situation to other movements...

If so, is there a way to make them fall in line with your views *and* not bigoted?

Taking the view that welfare, and housing programs both disproportionately aid minorities (I don't feel that either of them do), is there a solution that both reduces the amount of aid given, without also advocating a 'white-only' agenda?  Well, there probably is!

 * ""Community Organizing"" shown in a negative light.  Why do these people hate that he helped minorities? How is that a bad thing?

 * ""Border Fence"" They literally want to build a wall to keep foreigners out. There are a million ways to let them in and actually be advantageous to everyone... but no, they want to build a whole goddamn wall to keep them out.

 * [Studies](http://open.salon.com/blog/pwtenny/2010/08/09/study_shows_tea_partyers_more_likely_to_hold_racist_views) have shown that up to half, do, in fact, hold racist views.  

 * [Some Tea Party groups really are racist as a whole.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR6Rj6P_WPY)  I know this isn't all groups, but this one organized a protest against a peaceful organization, where they threatened their lives, screamed racial epithets, insulted their religion, and yelled at them to go back home.

 * EDIT: Thought of another one.  They're always trying to shut down mosques. There was that one in New York and near me in a city called Temecula there was a bunch of TP organized protests trying to shut one down.

I'm trying to make the case that *discrimination* can be good. We discriminate all the time based on intelligence, income, age, sex, etc. but that does not mean we harbor hatred for people of these different groups.

&gt; If you think that sometimes having higher prices for some races is a good thing

Of course it can be. If shutting out 5 rich white people from your store means that a low income immigrant can afford to buy more food for his three kids, that can (from an overall social welfare standpoint) be considered a good thing.

Your entire response shows that you don't even know what racism is. From wikipedia: Racism is the belief that there are inherent differences in people's traits and capacities that are entirely due to their race, however defined, and that, as a consequence, racial discrimination is justified.

Nowhere am I saying that there are inherent differences in races that justify discrimination. Allowing people a right to use their property as they wish has absolutely zippo to do with ""inherent differences in races that justify discrimination"". Furthermore, the few situations that I believe do justify discrimination are those that have nothing to do with inherent differences and everything to do with circumstance and helping disadvantaged groups. Honestly, in a more technical world it wouldn't be justified at all (for example, the grocer could require customers bring in income statements and then only allow low income shoppers -- allowing the same effect but better focused and without ignoring outliers), but there are simply cases where racial discrimination would be a better fit due to lack of data (would exclude unemployed, homeless), time constraints (does the grocer have time to check every customer's income in a way that would not allow for easy fraud?), and cultural concerns (people might be embarrassed to shop at the ""poor store"").

&gt;During the several investigations, the California Attorney General's Office offered O’Keefe immunity from prosecution in exchange for providing the raw videotapes related to ACORN offices in California. The AG's Report was released on April 1, 2010: it found the videos from ACORN offices in Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Bernardino to have been ""severely edited""; it found there was no evidence of criminal conduct on the part of ACORN employees, nor of any evidence that any employee intended to to aid or abet criminal conduct. It found that three employees had tried to deflect the couple's plans, told them ACORN could not offer them help on the grounds they wanted, and otherwise dealt with them appropriately. Such context was not reflected in O'Keefe's edited tapes. The AG's Report noted that, because the Giles-O'Keefe criminal plans were a ruse, the ACORN workers could not be complicit in them. It found no evidence of intent by the employees to aid the couple.

The vast majority of those border crossers would not have been treated as formal deportations under most previous administrations. If all removals were tallied, the total sent back to Mexico each year would have been far higher under those previous administrations than it is now.

The shift in who gets tallied helped the administration look tough in its early years but now may be backfiring politically. Immigration advocates plan protests across the country this week around what they say will be the 2 millionth deportation under Obama — a mark expected to be hit in the next few days. And Democratic strategists fret about a decline in Latino voter turnout for this fall's election.

Until recent years, most people caught illegally crossing the southern border were simply bused back into Mexico in what officials called ""voluntary returns,"" but which critics derisively termed ""catch and release.""

The idea that Trump has outpaced Obama's performance seems absurd, at best... and I am guessing another example of cooking the books in order to ""trick the data"" and show a favorable outcome.

This is similar to the way the Obama Administration cooked the books on illegal immigration, would be my accusation.

http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-deportations-20140402-story.html

The vast majority of those border crossers would not have been treated as formal deportations under most previous administrations. If all removals were tallied, the total sent back to Mexico each year would have been far higher under those previous administrations than it is now.

The shift in who gets tallied helped the administration look tough in its early years but now may be backfiring politically. Immigration advocates plan protests across the country this week around what they say will be the 2 millionth deportation under Obama — a mark expected to be hit in the next few days. And Democratic strategists fret about a decline in Latino voter turnout for this fall's election.

Until recent years, most people caught illegally crossing the southern border were simply bused back into Mexico in what officials called ""voluntary returns,"" but which critics derisively termed ""catch and release."" Those removals, which during the 1990s reached more 1 million a year, were not counted in Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation statistics.",I feel like your sources are probably slanted ,3447,14,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics

4457,"&gt; **New presidents haven’t done anything yet except be elected**. Protesting an election is protesting losing and protesting our political system.

The bold part isn't really true, and it affects the meaning of the second sentence. For starters, presidents are elected with a whole history of public (and sometimes, private) actions and interactions behind them. Even when newly elected, a president stands for *something*, whatever that may be, even if only policy goals. Protests at an inauguration really are directed at the new president and what they stand for, not particularly towards the direction of the political system.

Although that said, its not like our political system is beyond reproach, either. There's nothing wrong with taking a critical eye to our system of government and protesting it. Actually, I think it is rather unhealthy if we put it on a pedestal and pretend it is perfect...","Well the things they’ve done are in line with their campaign. The point is the country chose the president in our election system. Whether you like what he is or not the point of living in a democratic society is sometimes you don’t get your way. So protesting an inauguration is saying you don’t accept the system.

&gt;	Although that said, its not like our political system is beyond reproach, either

This is true but inauguration day isn’t the time to make that argument. It’s too late to do anything about it and it’s just sour grapes. The folks that protested in 2000, 2004, and 2016 weren’t protesting in 2008 so it’s clearly not about the system. It’s about the results.

4459,"What I'm saying, and what you are missing, is that the intentions of the protesters are not necessarily what you assume (if I read correctly, that is, as an attack or rejection of democracy). I would argue they were more motivated in response to a repugnance of Trump's personal and public actions.

If you recall, those protests were largely organized by women's rights groups, and this was hot on the heels of Trump's ""grab them by the pussy"" remarks, not to mention the loss of the Democratic appointment of the Supreme Court (which always raises the possibility of perhaps reversing Roe vs Wade), and the overall way in which Trump conducted his campaign (among other things, appearing at times to encourage the use of violence against political opponents, protesters, the press, etc). There were plenty of reasons to protest *Trump*. 

&gt;The folks that protested in 2000, 2004, and 2016 weren’t protesting in 2008 so it’s clearly not about the system. It’s about the results.

It could also be, you know, about the lack of congruence between the popular vote and the election results, perceived by many to be unfair. There was *a lot* to protest Bush in his second term... after all this was the administration that faked its way into a way with Iraq.","Every election the losers have many things to complain about. If we didn’t we wouldn’t have elections we would just appoint someone because we all agree.

But in America we have decided to hold elections to see who will represent us as president. Before 2000 we were mostly civil and accepted the outcome no matter how distasteful. The election decided who would lead. It’s what we had decided as a civil society to do.

In 2000, many Democrats decided they didn’t like losing and protested the decision that our society had come up with. In 2004 and in 2016 they decided to protest it again. And in 2004 Bush won the popular vote so it clearly wasn’t about the popular vote discrepancy.

They did not protest the 2008 and 2012 inaugurations so it’s hard to justify that it had anything to do with the process. They were fine with the process when their guy won. 

If we can’t even be civil on a day that used to just be a ceremony celebrating our proud history of peaceful transfers of power then how can we be civil about anything in politics.

Yes, at the level of Youtube comments people name call.

I don't think he's trying to do anything but line his own pockets, but he *is* a fascist.

That doesn't mean that ""Trump is literally Stalin"", because no one is actually saying that.

4520,"&gt; As cronyist political insiders go, I give Hillary a 5/10. 

Dude, the Clinton's ARE the Democratic party. They have a reputation for taking care of everyone really well who's shown to be an ally and get them to the top.

&gt; She hasn't made hundreds of millions off Wall Street. Her charity has made maybe that much but she's prevented from using that money for personal gain.

Remember... I'm just explaining how they feel about. You can argue the details all day, but from their perspective what they believe is she's a crook.

She definitely made a lot personally. I think their networth is 400m, a little under half of which came from speaking fees for she and Bill and many of which were from special interests like wall street and other large multinationals (much of which happened while she was actively involved with politics - That's the big issue here).  We have to separate the different types of crook we have. Trump came right around a time when people were really really wanting an outsider, money in politics was to blame for a lot of problems, and so on... They can see Trump's shadiness but it's not directly tied to politics. 

They can look at Trump and his shadiness and think, ""Well yeah... He's a businessman. Sometimes you are going to step on toes. But ultimately he just ripped off some other rich dudes."" That's how they view it... But then they see Clinton, and they think ""Oh she took money straight from big corporations for 'speaking' fees while in office. She didn't just rip off some corporations, but she's doing it at the expense of the USA as a whole!"" This is the big issue with Clinton. The perceptions is that she just ripped off the American people. That she's a crook willing to sell out the country. Perception-wise, Trump doesn't have that with his supporters. He's seen as a rich guy who doesn't need money any more and maybe ripped off some other elite rich dudese in the past. But ultimately loves America.

&gt; The idea that Trump is just an abrasive NYC talking playboy. He bragged about sexual assault, he has had settlement after settlement for accusations of racism in his businesses and sexual harassment

This is one where I even fall flat on, and kind of side with their perception on. The dude talked about being rich and powerful and how women like rich famous dudes, so much so that you can practically walk up and grab their pussy. I don't think most people are going to act shocked if a famous rich dude openly admits what we all know ""Women like famous powerful rich men"". So again, that's going to fall flat for them.

Same with the Muslim thing. Conservatives reject the idea of multiculturalism. It's not that they are racist (even though the left tries to wedge them into being labeled that.) they just like their culture, way of life, and so on, and don't want to be bothered changing the way they live and have lived, for some outsiders. Muslim immigrants are pretty much the anti-thesis for conservatives. Islam is dangerous, sexist, and has a pretty violent recent history. So to conservatives, it's not so much that they are racist against brown people, just that they don't want that culture in America. 

&gt; No, it's him installing people who do not believe in the job they have so that he can parcel out regulatory capture to rich buddies, like with the EPA for example, and dismantling the CFB.

Again, from their perspective it's just your words. How do you know they are trying to engage in regulatory capture? Yeah, he's tearing down some institutions from within. He LITERALLY campaigned on doing that. Going in and shuffling up government to more align with your political philosophy (small government conservatism) is not fascism. 

&gt; They didn't threaten the press for criticizing him

I think this is the left's own doing for being really intellectually dishonest through the campaign. While I think 90% of what's reported is legit, much of it is partisan spin, and it's allowed for him to create a fake news narrative. But everyone of his supporters knows this. It's his politicking of defending himself from a press, which, is really really aggressive with him. But again, would classify it as facist. I'd put it into that category when it moves beyond rhetoric and into actually jailing and punishing the press... Which he has no intention in doing. He loves the press in secret because he knows how to play them like an instrument and spread his message.","&gt;Remember... I'm just explaining how they feel about. 

I agree. What they feel about it is only sustained in willing ignorance of the facts, and a cultivated distrust in experts.
&gt;This is one where I even fall flat on, and kind of side with their perception on.

I don't know how I can say this without being abrasive, but your response is basically excuses and downplays. Here:
&gt;Same with the Muslim thing. [...] So to conservatives, it's not so much that they are racist against brown people, just that they don't want that culture in America.

So why were the Phillipines not on the ban list?  Literally where most Muslims in the world live. Why is Saudi Arabia not on the list for that matter? Even if they were, how does that make them not racist? ""It's not that they're bigoted against another group, it's that they want to make it legal to discriminate against that other group"" is playing fast and loose with *words*. I don't really *care* that my grandfather doesn't like black people, I care that he *discriminates* against them, that he takes actions against them on the basis of their race. That's what *counts*. This is leaving out Trump's actual history of racial discrimination, not just against Mulsims.

Also, I agree wholeheartedly with the tax deduction idea. As a gun owner myself, it amazes me that people own guns but don't own a gun safe. The idea of spending hundreds and often thousands on something that is dangerous and frequently stolen, and then putting in your closet, seems irresponsible and shortsighted. 

But the cats already out of the bag, and don't think we should ask people to spend hundreds of dollars without offering some assistance. They have been giving out trigger locks for years, so maybe there is funding available for a safe assistance program as well. ","&gt;Could you elaborate on why you'd like to avoid a registry?

A few issues.  We currently have 300+ million firearms in circulation and due the participation rate of state registries (4% in New York with their AWB) we can assume that most of the firearms will not be registered, especially those owned by less than savory individuals.  This will really impact the usefulness of the registry as a law enforcement tool and it would be made up of mostly newly sold firearms.  As firearms last for decades if not centuries with adequate maintenance we would have these unregistered guns pop up for years.  Even Australia who is seen as a gun control poster child only took in about 40% of the weapons they were targeting with their buy back and ban.  Guns are still found today and a recent amnesty lead to even more weapons being turned in after all of these years.

So we know that it will have limited value as a law enforcement tool, what will be the cost?  Canada has dabbled with a registry and projected it to cost only a few million with most costs being covered by licensing fees (something that has constitutional implications), yet costs ballooned and the few million dollar price tag ended up being a billion dollars and lead to the eventual end of their long gun registry.  A system that works and is large enough to meet the needs of the US and its diverse network of states might need to be even more robust and could have significant costs.  You would not be able to charge the amounts or charge annually like we do to support our car registry/DMV systems meaning that tax payers would have to pay for the bulk of this system and its maintenance.

Lastly, the future implications.  Our current system of FFL transfers for new gun purchases was a compromise.  The allowance of private sales was intentional in order to protect gun owners and prevent a registry.  The ability to have private sales dilutes the FFL records and prevents the government from being able to tie individual to a specific firearm.  While this limits the usefulness of trying to trace a firearm, something police still do, it does allow a citizen to some protection from confiscation.  The government would have to violate 4th amendment rights and would literally have to go door to door to successfully confiscate weapons.  With a registry, the government would know where each gun is supposed to be and could simply send a letter to the owner informing them to destroy, turn in to authorities, or face legal consequences.  This is something that Norway is doing right now to gun owners that legally bought and own Mini-14 rifles.  New York, Connecticut, and Hawaii have also all had their own dealings with confiscations or potential confiscations.  Denver has also put in law creating a bump stock ban with mandatory confiscation (no one turned in their bump stock).  Bans with confiscation becomes increasingly more likely if the government has the tools to specifically identify owners and can collect if necessary.  The lack of a registry is one of the reasons that grandfathering current owners is often the choice because of the inability to enforce a confiscation.

At the end of the day, registries equal confiscations.  We have examples in the US, around the world, current and historical.  This is a very dangerous tool to give the government, certainly when we have seen state governments already attempt to use them to do exactly what people have warned they would, confiscate.

Which implies that illegal immigrants are more criminal than the existing American population, but [as politifact points out](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/06/donald-trump/trump-immigration-claim-has-no-data-back-it/)

I'm sorry but it seems plain as day that what drives Trump to make statements like this one is racist stereotyping, if not within himself then within his audience for his political gain though IMO its a little column a, a little column b.  This particular stereotype (""The Cholo"") even has [its own little corner of wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypes_of_Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans_in_the_United_States#The_cholo), right above [the entry for illegal migrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypes_of_Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans_in_the_United_States#The_%22illegal_alien%22/_%22job_stealer%22).
