"C: Speaking exclusively about [Section 2 of the Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/04/presidential-executive-order-promoting-free-speech-and-religious-liberty)...

[26 U.S. Code § 501 - Exemption from tax on corporations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501) defines the qualifying criteria on fully tax-exempt religious organizations as such:

&gt; [Any religious] foundation, organized and operated exclusively for religious... purposes..., no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation..., and which does not participate in, or intervene in..., any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.  

The stated purpose of the Executive Order Sec. 2. is, ""Respecting Religious and Political Speech"" -- i.e. so as to allow this sort of political activism under the protection of constitutional free speech without any threat or action of revocation of tax-exempt status as a 501(c)-3 organization.  

---
There is some important context to consider:  

First, being a 501(c)-3 organization means that not only is the organization's income tax-exempt, but **also the donations of individuals to the foundation are tax-deductible to those individuals.**  

Second, there are other provisions under this section of the tax code that still provide tax-exempt status on the organization's income (e.g. 501(c)-4). The ~~only~~ relevant difference is that the **individual donations would no longer be tax-deductible for those individuals.** The tax-exempt status of the organization's income would remain intact under other, similar classifications that are not impacted by the Johnson Amendment.

Third, in approximately the last 20 years, not one 501(c)-3 organization has had its status as such revoked as a result of violating the Johnson Amendment.

That third point ostensibly demonstrates that, in effect, the Johnson Amendment already doesn't exist as it is not being enforced. Therefore the Executive Order effectively accomplishes very little of substance with regard to ""Respecting Religious and Political Speech"".

"B: There's a lot of controversy in some religious circles that you can't be a non-profit religious group and specifically endorse a candidate because of what's called the ""Johnson Amendment"". You can definitely say, ""Don't vote for someone who favors abortion, favor only Christian candidates."" You a line like, ""Donald Trump is an immoral candidate,"" is questionable because you can't specifically campaign against a candidate, though the limits of that have never been explored.  You under current rules, you're not supposed to say, ""Hilary Clinton is a murderer, Donald Trump is an adulterer, vote Jill Stein, baby, for a verdant Christian world!"" That is, endorse a specific candidate and tell your flock how to vote. 

However, some churches go out of their way to record themselves saying just this, and mail these tapes to the IRS saying, essentially, ""Try me."" Since 2008, this has been organized as ""Pulpit Freedom Sunday"". To my knowledge, the IRS says this is something that can make a religious organization lose its non-profit status, but they have maybe only done it once (when a church place an ad in the USA Today saying it would be sinful to vote for Clinton comma Bill) and officially stopped all investigations since 2009 (Thanks, Obama?):

&gt;It was after the IRS lost a 2009 lawsuit over its procedural process in investigating the Living Word Christian Center following the church's endorsement of former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., that the agency halted investigations, according to Politico.

&gt;The IRS sued the church for refusing to hand over its records, but a judge threw out the case over the fact that a regional commissioner should have been approving church audits. The job, however, had been axed from the agency ranks, meaning that the government was using lower-level IRS staffers, which the judge said was inappropriate.

That's from a real good [*Deseret News* (close to the Mormon Church) article about the issue](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865658366/The-long-2-and-surprising-2-history-behind-the-IRS-ban-on-churches-endorsing-political-candidates.html), which gives a great history. Repealing the Johnson Amendment was in the Republican Platform in 2016. (Ironically, it seems the Johnson amendment was [adopted in 1954 to prevent two *secular* non-profit organizations from campaigning against Johnson](http://blogs.christianpost.com/liberty/the-johnson-amendment-is-a-fat-opossum-2881/).)

Whether this EO weakens or strengthens the Johnson Amendment frustratingly depends on legal interpretation, but it [may further weaken the already neutered Johnson Amendment](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/trump-ease-tax-rules-religious-groups-may-endorse-political-candidates/) and, at the very least, should be seen as a signal to Evangelicals and other conservative religious groups that they can safely ignore the Johnson Amendment. 

&gt;Ralph Reed, a longtime evangelical leader and founder of the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition, said he was briefed by White House officials about the text of the executive order. [...]

&gt;“This administratively removes the threat of harassment.”
Reed said he was “thrilled” by the language on the IRS restrictions on partisan political activity. “This administratively removes the threat of harassment,” Reed said in a phone interview. “That is a really big deal.” He said the language in the order related to the preventive care mandate will “ensure that as long as Donald Trump is president, that something like the Little Sisters of the Poor case will never happen again.”

The Little Sisters of the Poor is a separate issue(Section 3), and I was mainly talking about Sections 2 and 4. So I disagree with all those that say it doesn't actually do anything. It, at the very least, is a strong signal. That's certainly how people like Reed are taking it, after all. ",(pass),6759,17,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: That's a document from 1993 (notice the title and that it cites things from 1989, 1991, and 1992, but nothing after) which I believe is thoroughly outdated. Do you have anything more current? From everything I've read, nothing in the last twenty years resembles that at all. Again, literally one church is known to have lost its tax-exempt status due to political activities.  From what I know, I believe these sorts of issue-based discussions are relatively common, and the recent interpretation of the rule has generally been that it's outright political endorsements which are treyf, ""issue-based"" advocacy is kosher. From that PBS article cited above:

&gt;The regulation, named for then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson, was put into force in 1954 and prohibited partisan political activity for churches and other tax-exempt organizations. The policy still allows a wide range of advocacy on political issues, but in the case of houses of worship, it bars electioneering and outright political endorsements from the pulpit. The rule has rarely been enforced.

&gt;The IRS does not make public its investigations in such cases, but only one church is known to have lost its tax-exempt status as a result of the prohibition. The Church at Pierce Creek in Conklin, New York, was penalized for taking out newspaper ads telling Christians they could not vote for Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election. Even so, some religious leaders have argued the rule has a chilling effect on free speech, and have advocated for years for repeal.","&gt; which I believe is thoroughly outdated

&gt; President Trump’s prior assertion that he wished to ‘totally destroy’ the Johnson Amendment with this order has proven to be a textbook case of ‘fake news.’

Pepperidge Farm remembers when fake news was a term referring specifically to articles that had the appearance of legitimate news, but were actually fiction (or distortions of the truth intended to reshape reality). Trump (et al) has degraded this term to refer to any presentation of facts that are distasteful.  

Here, the ACLU has used the term here to refer to a (campaign) lie, or a statement of intent that he has failed to make real, further degrades the term.

I object to this because, without the term ""fake news"" to refer to *actual fake news* [sic], fake news gets even more dangerous. The water is muddy, and that term helped clarify it.

Isn't that exactly what Trump does? When he is saying this order ""totally destroys"" the Johnson Amendment, when it really doesn't, and his statements are meant to make it seem like he's taking hard action against 'attacks on religion', would that not be a) distortion of the truth and b) reshaping what reality shows?

It's fiction. It's false. It really does not do that. It's more than a distasteful presentation, it distorts the truth in a way that misleads its audience.

The abolishment of the electoral college in popoular elections, which grant [certain citizens of different districts of different states far more voting power than others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banzhaf_power_index).

It's extremely unlikely for Trump to make claims using extralegal measures and to have them stick, unless he had no confidence in this country's law enforcement capabilities and is planning to dismantle the FBI, the CIA, the DHS, etc...and to replace them with his own version of law enforcement, which would probably be some form of martial law or dictatorship.  Sounds crazy, but well, that's where Trump's claims go.

Bottom line, there has to be cause for an investigation.

It would seem that these countries not only have a similar standard of living to the United States, but receive more government services. Furthermore, they have less deferred debt and have better job security. 

However, these countries also spend tiny fractions of their already small GDPs on defense. Norway spends 7.2b (1.4%), Finland spends 2.7b (1.3%), Switzerland spends 4.83b (.7%), Denmark spends 3.7b (~1.3%) and Sweden spends 5.7b (~1.1%). These numbers are all adjusted to USD. [6](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS)

The United States has good diplomatic relations with all of these countries. Denmark is engaged in Afghanistan along with US troops [7](http://www.fmn.dk/eng/allabout/Pages/ThedanishengagementinAfghanistan.aspx) [8](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3167.htm). Sweden and the US are strong economic partners [9](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2880.htm). Norway is a NATO member [10](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/nato_countries.htm). The US is an important economic partner for Finland [11](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3238.htm). Switzerland and the US actively work together to counter money-laundering, terrorism, and other activities [12](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3431.htm).

The point that I'm trying to make is that all of these countries are supported by the US in such a way that would suggest that if they were to be attacked the US would support them militarily. This would explain the relatively low spending on defense by these countries. 

If these countries were forced to supply their own defense, would they be able to support their social programs? What does this say about the possibility of the US adapting similar social programs?","The US military budget is one gigantic humongous lie.

"A: I don't think it says much, honestly. When you look at tax rates, all of the Nordic countries have a VAT (which is a consumption/sales tax) of around 25%, whereas the US national average is 5.45%.

Current revenue generated by sales tax in the United States is [$490 billion](http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/year_revenue_2016USrn_17rs1n_40#usgs302). That would turn into $2.248 trillion if tax levels were increased to the rates they are in the Nordic countries.

What additional funds would be available if military spending was cut to NATO recommended levels, or Sweden's? NATO recommends 2% of GDP, which would be roughly $340 billion, $276 million less than current levels. 0.7% would be around $119 billion, a potential savings of $497 billion. Both of those totals are still relatively modest compared to the revenue totals yielded from a VAT equivalent. That's the real difference, not defense spending. (Obviously very imprecise calculations, but the difference is still pretty significant).

From the Nordic perspective, the Finlands and Swedens of the world are never going to have the responsibilities of a regional or great power - they don't have the economy or population for it. If the US, for some reason, abdicated from its European responsibilities, I doubt we'd see defense spending increase a great deal, but rather more emphasis on the European Union's potential role as a collective security organization (facilitating a joint nuclear deterrent, conventional military support from larger countries).

It all comes down to what the people actually want - do Americans want higher taxes to pay for stronger social insurance programs? The answer, generally speaking, is no. Could it be done? Absolutely, but not by gutting the defense budget.","What constitutes ""gutting"" the defense budget?

However, no reduction in responsibilities in the Middle East or the War on Terror were included, while Congress has pushed for budget cuts.  

Take a look at our carrier force - we've temporarily dropped down to 10 ships for a few years and with it we've had much longer deployments per ship than in the past, which has pushed back maintenance cycles, which has hurt morale and made repairs more costly in the end, etc. It was only this year Congress finally waived the statute requiring a US carrier in the Persian Gulf at all times

Correction: Switzerland doesn't expect help from anybody if it were to come under attack. The reason why the military budget is so low is because 5 billion CHF per year is already plenty sufficient for the level of threat Switzerland currently faces, but mostly because the Swiss military is extremely wasteful with the money in the first place (I know somebody in the mountain corps that was ordered to ski on gravel, just so that the army could claim it needed new skis, and therefore keep it's budget).

Norway is around 5 million people, Sweden around 9.5 and Finland also around 5. 
This is in effect, the administrative equivalent of running New York State divided between three countries. Northern Europe is, in my view proof positive of the whole ""small is beautiful"" thesis. 
The United States by contrast, spans a continent and has a population 17 times larger. 
Nordic states, are very productive and exceptional places to live, but (and yes I am generalizing here) bureaucracies can remain small and lean by comparison. A Federal attempt to set up social programs like those in Sweden would be absolutely gargantuan projects, ministering to a group probably orders of magnitude larger than the entire Nordic population. This is not to say that it is bad, but rather only point out what is in my view the main obstacle. 

For the Nordic countries, I doubt a large enough tax base exists for them to acquire and maintain the strategic systems necessary to deter a country like...Russia. They all rely upon mutual self defense and some rely upon NATO. I think if the Nordic countries did up defense spending to 2%, the marginal benefit wouldn't be that great. Maybe each country might stand up a new Brigade or Regiment or increase readiness rates or something, but in strategic terms, this isn't disruptive. Sure, it would result in either a tax increase or a cut to some services, but I doubt a raise to 2% of GDP would cause a societal shift away from the welfare state. 

The criticism the US levels at European powers regarding defense spending is directed to larger ones with a Defense Industrial Base. Think Germany, The UK, to a lesser extent, France.

The rationale for the original provision only comes down to us in fragments, though a fear that high levels of federal taxation might “absorb all [the states’] taxable resources,” a concern first addressed in the Federalist Papers, appears to have held sway.

I will happily defend that moral assertion.  But you'll note, that in this long thread, not a single person has offered a MORAL defense of why someone making 100k in alabama should pay more federal tax than someone making 100k in new york.  When pressed, they all fall back on some other argument

&gt;Fundamentally, our tax dollars are to be used, as the Constitution puts it, to provide and promote the common welfare.

that's not what the constitution says.  

&gt;Similarly, federal grants are given to those states that have trouble providing for their own citizens. This comes in many forms from welfare programs given to directly to individuals (like medicaid, financial assistance, food stamps, and energy assistance), to larger programs targeted at whole communities (like education grants to local schools, grants to cities to build infrastructure, and farm subsidies). Some states, however, are better able to provide for their own citizens and do not need to receive as much money from the federal government to assist with these programs. Generally these states can better provide for their citizens because they pay more in state taxes.

Let's assume this is the case.  In that case, you should be in favor of abolishing salt.   Your argument here is, essentially, that some states are too poor to pay for a decent lives for themselves, and need help.  Alright, that's a consistent, sound argument.  what isn't sound is to ""some states are too poor, and they need help, so they should be taxed more and their own money given back to them as aid.""  If you truly believe that the richer states should help the poorer, then the LAST thing you should want is SALT, since it generally transfers money away from poorer states.

I believe I did make that argument. The moral argument is that I am paying the state to provide certain services that the federal government offers. If I am paying the state to give me those services, why should I also need to pay the government for those services?

&gt;&gt; Fundamentally, our tax dollars are to be used, as the Constitution puts it, to provide and promote the common welfare.

 &gt;that's not what the constitution says.

Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution:

""The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States;""


&gt; Let's assume this is the case. In that case, you should be in favor of abolishing salt. Your argument here is, essentially, that some states are too poor to pay for a decent lives for themselves, and need help. Alright, that's a consistent, sound argument. what isn't sound is to ""some states are too poor, and they need help, so they should be taxed more and their own money given back to them as aid."" If you truly believe that the richer states should help the poorer, then the LAST thing you should want is SALT, since it generally transfers money away from poorer states.

That would be a valid argument if states were destined for some reason to always be poor and unable to pay for their own programs. But a major reason why they are too poor to pay for their programs is that their state and local taxes are too low, and thus they require more aid from the federal government. If they had higher taxes and spent that money on these programs, they wouldn't need to spend receive so much money from the federal government and everyone's federal taxes could be lower. Why should the people of my state subsidize another state for their own fiscal irresponsibility?


You see, I am of the opinion that a person knows best how to spend their own money, followed by their municipality, then their state, and finally the federal government. I am absolutely fine with higher state and local taxes if it means fewer federal taxes, because my state and locale can better address my needs in a much more efficient manner than the federal government can. What I don't like is the federal government robbing Peter to pay Paul.

&gt;&gt;Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution:
&gt;
&gt;Common welfare and general welfare are not the same thing.  General welfare is a specific, and legally loaded, phrase.  

Not, it really isn't. In fact, one of the reasons that clause is so controversial is that general welfare is not defined anywhere and can be as broad or narrow as the interpereter wants it to be. Madison, for instance, favored the narrow inteperetation, while Hamilton argued that it meant Congress coupd lay wahetever taxes they wanted so long as it would provide benefit to the nation.

No, you didn't. You just said they were wrong without giving any reason. Looks at the data: states that have higher taxes receive tend to receive less block grants and aid from the federal government. That is a fact. My argument is that this is, in part, because their higher state and local taxes are paying for programs that would otherwise be funded in part by block grants from the federal government.


&gt;&gt;Why should the people of my state subsidize another state for their own fiscal irresponsibility? 
&gt;
&gt;They shouldn't.  And if you think they are, the proper response is to abolish the programs you think they are abusing, not force them to pay taxes for programs that they don't want. 

I am also in favor of that, but given as that is not going to happen, it is a stupid idea to raise  people's taxes to pay for the fiscal irresponsibility of other states.

&gt; Your argument amounts to saying that you should tax people on welfare for the cost of the their welfare, in order to teach them not to use welfare. it's incoherent.

"B: It may not be a MORAL defense, but perhaps its helps to distinguish whether the purpose of tax deductions is to be ""fair"" or to add some economic incentive to a desired behavior.
If we think of deduction as an economic incentive to do the ""right"" thing then SALT deductions might make more sense. Items such as student loan interest, charitable donations,  and medical costs are deductible because we want people to educate themselves, help out the less fortunate, and help prevent medically induced poverty. We increase tax on cigarettes, alcohol, and other behaviors we want to discourage. The criticism of the estate tax is that it double taxes income, but we justify this because we are trying to discourage the accumulation of excessive generational wealth. Alternatively, SALT deductions remove the double taxing of income because we want to encourage states to be pro-active in improving schools and roads, and increasing their emergency slush funds.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to message us.","&gt;That's the argument WalletHub analysts make in their 2014 Report on Best and Worst States to Be a Taxpayer.

But that's *not* the argument WalletHub makes when they look at [federal dependency](https://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700/), which shows hardly any correlation between effective tax rates and their metric for federal dependency. If states were actually using federal aid to artificially cut their own taxes, you'd expect a much stronger negative correlation.

Whether a state is a net recipient or contributor of federal funds is explained much more by that state's GDP than by the state [tax rates](https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-states-to-be-a-taxpayer/2416/) for a median taxpayer. The correlation between those effective tax rates and federal dependency, using WalletHub's numbers, is only about -0.13. That's pretty much nothing.

When I looked at that my first thought was, well, maybe median rates are a poor indicator since higher earners are much more likely to itemize and take SALT deductions. Turns out that's not a great argument either.

Even if you look at the correlation between federal dependency and the maximum of [state and local sales tax](https://taxfoundation.org/state-and-local-sales-tax-rates-in-2017/) or the [highest state income tax brackets](https://taxfoundation.org/state-individual-income-tax-rates-brackets-2017/), the correlation between a state's tax rate and its dependency on federal funding just isn't there.

The only rate that makes sense for this comparison is property taxes, which do in fact have a moderate correlation with WalletHub's measure of federal dependency. State property taxes are still deductible in the house's tax bill, though.

Relying on federally subsidized states to raise their own taxes to fund welfare programs in the federal governments stead is sort of wishful thinking regardless, but it doesn't seem backed up by the data either.

So instead of getting up in arms about SALT, get angry about where the GOP plan is *cutting* taxes. SALT deductions are worth about [1.8 trillion](https://taxfoundation.org/eliminating-salt-deduction-big-six-tax-plan/) over a decade, so it should seem bizarre that even after partially eliminating them the house tax bill is [1.7 trillion in the hole](http://www.breitbart.com/economics/2017/11/08/cbo-says-house-tax-bill-will-add-1-7-trillion-deficits/) over the same time frame.

https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-highest-lowest-tax-burden/20494/","I would agree that it certainly seems politically motivated, but that doesn't mean blue states should use dubious reasons to defend SALT either.

The argument that's been coming up in this thread is that, as I understand it, SALT is an incentive for more local governance which blue states are taking advantage of more often than red states, and that this explains the differences in federal funding. So instead of removing SALT, red states should just raise their taxes and replace federal programs with (presumably more efficient) local ones.

If you look at the analysis on the pages being linked, though, federal dependency depends on how rich or poor a state is much more than that state's tax rates. Tax rates or tax burdens correlate quite weakly with federal dependency* while tax income, average SALT deduction, or other things measured in dollars show a stronger correlation since they include an effect from that state's GDP and not just the state's tax policy.

So if federally dependent states can't wean themselves off that funding by raising taxes, then this particular argument for defending SALT doesn't seem coherent.

\* Take the numbers from WalletHub and throw them in Excel or otherwise look at the correlations yourself. Total tax burden vs federal dependency is *r* = -0.15, or *r* = -0.20 if you go by rank. That seems too low to draw serious conclusions from to me. 

EDIT: In fact, here's a [picture](https://imgur.com/a/H8dF1), color coded for how each state voted in 2016 (and omitting Delaware since it's an outlier/tax haven, which improves the numbers a little but we're still looking at r = -0.24).",7340,129,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

"A: &gt;I bet if you normalize both axis 0-1 and plot a line y=x, you will find that Red states cluster on the low tax-federally dependent side of the curve.

You're not wrong. [Scaled](https://imgur.com/a/V2r81), with quadrants and y=x sloppily added in paint.

However, while red states are more likely overall to have lower tax burdens their federal dependencies are still all over the map. West Virginia and Mississippi already have above average tax burdens but they're some of the most dependent states, for example. Meanwhile Florida, Alaska, and Oklahoma are in the low dependence quadrant but have some of the lowest tax burdens on the graph (and Alaska is unusual, sure, but Oklahoma?)

Ultimately, though, I don't think our interpretations of the data are incompatible. It's possible for red states to be more dependent *and* for dependency to be mostly independent from tax policy. Blue states are less dependent but have a wide range of tax burdens. Red states have lower taxes and a wide range of dependency. The result is that red states are more likely to be dependent than blue ones, but not that high dependency red states could change this by raising taxes (since plenty of low dependency red states have similar or lower tax rates.)

Eliminating SALT is almost certainly a partisan move that will redistribute wealth from blue states to red ones. That doesn't automatically make the federal dependency argument for SALT deductions correct, however, *even if* blue states are less dependent on average.

(If you compared what each state *spends* its tax revenue on it might be the case that red states aren't spending effectively, which you could model by artificially lowering their tax burdens depending on some efficiency gap. I'm not keen on looking into that, since it's much thornier, but it might give you the correlation you want. Then you're in the tenuous position of hoping red states will raise taxes to fund programs that red states are traditionally against, though. That's less an argument in favor of SALT deductions and more of an argument for stronger federal regulation to bring backwards states up to par.)","You turned that graph around quick!

So I guess you are thinking from a pure calculus of the number stand point, I'm coming at it from more of a social angle. Let say you live and pay taxes in a Blue state, with high taxes and the following conditions happen:

1.) Red states tend to get back more than they give from the federal government

2.) The federal government, controlled by Republicans, will be effectively raising taxes for people in high tax states which tend to be blue by getting rid of one of the oldest parts of the income tax code. 

The first point alone is a tolerable injustice, but when you get to 2), it crosses a line for some since it seems to accelerate the injustice of 1). There was a famous experiment with [Capuchin monkeys on this topic](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/02/27/283348422/that-s-unfair-you-say-this-monkey-can-relate). Its called [social inequality aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequity_aversion) and it could be corrosive to people living in high performing (GDP), high state tax, blue states like CA or NY. This could result in the metaphorical ""throwing back of the Cucumber"", that is, blue states start to invest less in infrastructure and education to become more on par with places like Alabama or Kentucky. Turning California into the next Alabama or New York into the next Kentucky is effectively an economic nightmare scenario for the nation.

Some states receive more money from the federal government, than what the pay in Federal Income taxes.   Kentucky received much more money (thanks Mr. McConnell and Mr. Paul!), than it paid in income taxes.   So, effectively when you look at one state, perhaps the SALT is high, simply as a result they have to tax for what the federal government doesn't pay to them.

"A: &gt; but what in the fuck does that have to do with this tax bill specifically targeting blue states and creating a larger imbalance at the federal level

The imbalance does not exist because Federal tax policy targets blue states. The imbalance exists because  federal tax policy is progressive and taxes the wealthy in order to pay benefits to the poor. Coincidentally, the wealthy are concentrated in blue states, and the poor in red states. It also tends to build military bases in areas where land is cheap so you can have a lot of it. Surprise surprise, land is much cheaper in Georgia then California (although California does have several incredibly large bases). 

&gt; I don't see what the discussion of the tax bill, are you arguing it will have a positive effect on the cost of living? Because there no basis for that.

What I mentioned was the effects on weakening the Mortgage Interest Deduction (MID). Housing cost is the biggest factor in overall cost of living, especially in California. Yet the MID [has no effect on home ownership, it just pushes people to get larger and more expensive houses](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137712000514). By weakening this incentive, the federal government gets out of the game of distorting housing values and driving up the COL. 

&gt; I don't think people like you realize that the cause of high prices in California is crazy demand with tons of people moving here and the occurance of high salaries. You can fomain about policy all day long but that is 95% of the reason prices are high. Also show me somewhere where home owners don't protect their home prices.

Cost of living is a supply and demand problem. If salaries rise, so does demand. But if the state doesn't let the housing supply rise to meet demand, or energy production rise to meet demand, or any number of other goods now being competed by between more dollars then prices will rise. As to people moving here, [California has a big outmigration problem](http://www.ocregister.com/2017/04/23/leaving-california-after-slowing-the-trend-intensifies/) with 12,000 people net leaving the bay area last year. 

As to showing somewhere homeowners don't protect prices [here's a chart to what states have the most and least land use restrictions] (https://www.freedominthe50states.org/custom/land-use/frent/frtp/fwrluri/mindex). CATO is definitely right leaning, but its data is from the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index which from a cursory google search appears to be solid. So to answer your question as to where homeowners don't protect their home prices the answer is probably nowhere, but the NIBYism of Red States doesn't hold a candle to that of California and the North East. 

&gt; You must make nothing if the new standard deduction and child tax credit cancels out the SALT deduction for you to even out and get a couple hundred bucks back, cause for the vast majority of us here it raises our taxes.

Does it? Granted my households cash compensation is only 64k, but that's barely below [median household income statewide], although I guess I'm about 10k shy of median family income for a family of 4. I'm better off than many Californians though because I have a good benefit package and healthcare, so I would venture to say I am probably around average if not above it. Using [this calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator#JtpTIVU9W7) my estimated state sales, income, and fuel taxes for 2017 are a bit over 4,000. Nowhere near where I would need to be to consider itemizing, its the MID that would probably make it worth my while. We can argue all day about what's middle class in California, but the term is so overused its almost meaningless at this point. For those in California and in the middle who can't afford to buy a home, this bill really doesn't impact them, and depending on the size of the child tax credit could actually help, maybe even to cover the new gas tax we're all coughing up now.","I stopped reading here:

However, I think the elimination of the SALT deduction is an attack on Federalism. I found a nice explanation by the [Governor's Lobby](https://www.nga.org/cms/policy-positions/executive-committee/principles-for-state-federal-relations) (yes the Governor's have a lobby)

&gt;2.2.1 Congress should not interfere with state revenue systems. The independent ability of states to develop their own revenue systems is a basic tenet of self government and our federalist system. The federal government should not enact any legislation or adopt any regulation that would preempt, either directly or indirectly, sources of state revenues, state tax bases, or state taxation methods.

Edit: made second to last sentence clear",7340,151,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: &gt; But if doing away with the SALT deductions interferes with state revenue systems does this mean that all Federal Taxes interfere with state revenue systems?

Maybe, but I'm not making that argument. I'm saying eliminating the SALT deduction will drive behaviors that will interfere with some State's ability to collect revenue. It can be a simple as: now that people can't deduct SALT, the state has no choice but to cut taxes or lose tax base. Perhaps there are good reasons for the State to tax and spend as they do. If you are thinking ""hell ya the federal government should push the States to lower their taxes"". I simply disagree and find this counter to the tenants of federalism and State sovereignty. 

&gt;the benefit goes to six states (California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas, and Pennsylvania)

Those 6 states account for over 40% of the nations GDP.

I'm going to disagree with your DWL angle: Eliminating the salt deduction will effectively drive the behavior of people trying to avoid paying property tax and state income tax (easiest way is by downsizing or moving to another state) and sending a greater share of their money to the Federal government, who, in my opinion, use the money less wisely than local government in many ways.

The tax bill increases the deficit yet will probably raises my taxes and is extremely partisan. I find the only reason someone would support this bill is if their wealthy donors want them to. Perhaps this is why the corporate tax cuts were permanent, but the middle class tax cut for you and I expire.

Now its solely a matter of opinion if this is bad or not, but we would probably see a different picture if the poor and middle class could deduct against their FICA taxes as well, instead of just income taxes.

But what I was arguing earlier is that peoples final tax bill is going to be similar whether the deduction stays or not. If they let the wealthy deduct their state and local taxes, then they're going to raise the income tax rate, or the capital gains rate, or lower other deductions. People's bottom line will remain the same overall, because we tax to pay for the programs that get enacted, not simply for the sake of taxing. And its been a long while since any programs have been rolled back in any meaningful sense. As to people downsizing or moving to another state, I find this to be a benefit of Federalism.

I'd argue that the federal government incentivizing localities cut services so that it makes sense that the central government can be the sole provider to be the **exact opposite** of federalism. The central government should give deference to how the state see fit to spend their money.

Exactly! Why would you want to incentivize California to turn into Alabama?

You may not be a rich Californian, but California is the richest largest GPD state in the nation. I'd argue its because they probably have close to right sized government on the [Rhan curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahn_curve). You can get a fine higher education and there are jobs. Federal taker states like Alabama or Kentucky have low [GDP per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_GDP_per_capita) because they didn't invest in education and infrastructure like California did. To me this very much feels like the grasshopper taxing the ant for being too prudent.

When the drought ended last year the countries largest dam nearly collapsed. They've jacked the gas tax and vehicle registration fees up in response (including on electric vehicles), but this tends to be a very regressive tax in a state already struggling with poverty.

If California is the ant saving up for winter, it certainly isn't keeping it in the pension fund.

","I'm going to try to specifically address the reason as to why Egyptians are protesting as opposed to why they should be upset about things. There are plenty of countries with crippling un/underemployment, oppressive regimes, etc., and you don't see mass protests like those in Egypt. So I'm going to specifically attempt to address the mobilization factor in the Egyptian context.

**Economic woes**

This [NYT summary](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/21/opinion/egypts-economic-crisis.html?_r=0) should provide you with decent context. This line in particular is, in my mind, the crux of the matter: ""Egyptians want jobs, education and a say in governance."" These are all interconnected. The economic issues have backing in previous economic structures and the educational system.

Prior to the 2011 Revolution, Egypt was heavily dependent on two sources of income: tourism and foreign direct investment. Pre-revolution tourism accounted for around 11% of Egypt's GDP according to the OECD (cited in this [BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21293299)) Donors (and tourists) began to withdraw their investment from the country in droves in light of continued ongoing instability. This has contributed to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound and recent oil shortages.

Second, wealth in Egypt is highly concentrated in wealthy families and the military. This is not an argument will hear mentioned in Egyptian discourse, but a large issue with implementing any meaningful structural reform is challenging the stakeholders that benefit from the status quo. Zeinab abul-Magd wrote recently of this  in [Foreign Policy](http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/05/08/the_egyptian_republic_of_retired_generals). The largest issue is, as she states: 

&gt;Moreover, retired generals manage the vast enterprises owned by the military institution and produce goods and services for consumers rather than for military production. This includes chains of factories, service companies, farms, roads, gas stations, supermarkets, and much more. There are three major military bodies engaged in civilian production: the Ministry of Military Production, running eight factories; the Arab Organization for Industrialization, running 12 factories; and the National Service Products Organization, running 15 factories, companies, and farms. They produce a wide variety of goods, including luxury jeeps, infant incubators, butane gas cylinders, plastic tubes, canned food, meat, chicken, and more. They also provide services, like domestic cleaning and gas station management. 

In sum, the Egyptian economy is poorly structured and dependent on the state for economic dynamism, and the vested interests at the top have no interest in changing the status quo. This is combined with the fact that for years, Egyptian standards of living were increasing and are now being eroded by the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. Expectations are increasingly misaligned with reality, forcing average Egyptians to attempt to find redress through the state that largely created said expectations.

**Education**
One of Gamal Abdel Nasser's greatest contributions to Egyptian society was easing access to primary and secondary education. Colleges were made free to all pending successful passage of the Egyptian exam system. While in principle this is excellent, this sort of plays into the economic issues discussed above. Average Egyptians for years were essentially guaranteed jobs in government prior to the infitah (opening) reforms of Sadat and Mubarak. Economic restructuring forced the Egyptian government to cut public sector jobs and privatize government services that previously supplied jobs to Egyptian business majors and attorneys, as well as (and perhaps most notably) college-educated women. It can easily be argued that these reforms needed to be made, but the underlying reason for the job programs' existence was not addressed by the regime. As a result, there are vast sums of well-educated younger Egyptians (your prime ""revolutionary class,"" so to speak) that are currently unemployed, or more often underemployed and working in tourism or unrelated sectors. When the tourism sector was devastated following the revolution, these jobs became even less readily available than before. Just as an anecdote to demonstrate the extent of underemployment in Egypt, when I lived there in 2010, the person who installed the internet in my apartment in Cairo was an attorney by training.

**Polarization**
I would argue the catalyst for the recent protests has been the extent to which elements of Egyptian society have become detached from one another. Nathan Brown highlights this in his [recent piece](http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/06/27/will_june_30_be_midnight_for_morsis_cinderella_story) for Foreign Policy written immediately prior to the June 30 protests:

&gt;Egyptian politics now seems to operate in two parallel universes. On the one side is a simple story of a president and ruling political party that suffered years of oppression but were finally rewarded by the Egyptian people for their endurance, dedication, and honesty. Endowed with clear democratic and constitutional legitimacy -- and brought to power on the heels of a popular uprising that his movement helped lead -- President Morsi suddenly faces an array of forces who wish to rewrite the rules of the political game in a blatant attempt to overthrow the express will of the people. Stopping at nothing (the opposition uses false charges, accepts foreign assistance, uses shrill and incendiary rhetoric, refuses dialogue, and does not even stop at violating common decency by demonstrating in underwear), a collection of rude youth, power-hungry secular politicians, old regime elements, and scheming security services have conspired to declare, in effect, that Egyptians must be called to the ballot box only on condition that they reject Islamists (and if they make a mistake, they must be summoned back again).

&gt;On the other side is an equally simple story of a president who narrowly won office promising competence, inclusiveness, and conciliation but who delivered instead inflation, unemployment, power outages, fuel shortages, autocracy, sectarianism, and divisive rhetoric. Offering meaningless dialogues without the hint of concessions, his erstwhile allies have all abandoned him. And as the ranks of his critics have grown to the extent that they clearly have come to speak for the vast majority of Egyptians, the society has quite simply withdrawn confidence in him as president. Rather than following the text of a constitution that the president's party rammed through for its own purposes -- a constitution that would force the country through three more years of deterioration and despair -- Morsi should leave office now and allow the people to pick new leadership.

There are a few factors that seem to have led up to the recent protests. First, the opposition narrative, typically held by a disorganized mass that could never really get on the same page about anything consisting of leftists, labor leaders, youth movements, and the remnants of the Mubarak-era National Democratic Party, finally seems to have unified and expanded outside of its traditional base. More significantly, this narrative has become increasingly violent. Both sides increasingly see their visions for society threatened by the opposition, which is making compromise increasingly difficult. Due to all of the aforementioned issues, the military has seemed more primed than usual to intervene. In a transitional period into democratic governance, these types of events are more common than not. I think protests (though maybe not quite to this scale) will be semi-frequent over the next several years as the role of elements of society (Islam, the military, and the economy) come to take shape. It is a troubling time, for sure, but I don't believe the Egyptian experiment in democracy, even should there be a coup, be anywhere near over.",2778,5,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

Even with new leadership, they're bound by the same Constitution that Morsi's party wrote. Also, in many countries like Egypt, Pakistan, even the US....the military is a more respected institution than the police or the government. Martial Law in Egypt was gentler than Mubarak's rule and for an impious twenty-something, probably more livable than the Muslim Brotherhood as well.

This combination meant that legislatures controlled, in the words of a famous governor, ""[a fucking valuable thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Blagojevich)"" but didn't much care who got the seat.  this meant they were pretty free to auction it to the highest bidder, with little worry about the consequences, and they did so.  repealing the 17th directly would just create the same dynamic, my solution wouldn't.

Fair enough. It seemed upon my first read you were endorsing their viewpoints.

&gt;one of the benefits of the non-political lifetime appointment,

I'm confused by what you mean. How is that a benefit?

&gt;The lawmaking process is already accountable to the people directly through the House... And that same 'accountability to the people' necessarily comes with 'accountable to monied interests he/she is going to need to get reelected.'

I agree, that second part is politics. But you neglect to talk about voting - which is also required and fairly important to re-election.

I'm happy to agree to disagree. I don't see any benefit in a lifetime appointment. The Supreme court is extremely political, and the idea that they are not seems to me to be forced. They constantly rule on and change politics in this country. It's all they do, really. They don't preside over common criminals or land disputes - they re-write law with every single decision. It does not get more political, and many times their decisions - while they are supposed to be based in law - are seemingly made for no legal reason at all.

Just my opinion.","The benefit I see is that it makes the sitting judges as apolitical as possible; as much as every appointment stirs endless talking about 'litmus tests' and whatnot, ultimately it's a position that gets filled largely on the candidate's judicial bonafides over their politics. For good reason... If they were more 'accountable', 51% of the electorate could change constitutional law... The bedrock of our system needs stability.

And I'm totally *not* advocating lifetime appointments for senators. I may have tossed that out there, but only as one extreme possibility. But I am very interested in exploring options that work in a similar way... Look at DOMA... that passed the senate and became standing law not because it was just and prudent federal legislation, nor, IMO, because the sitting senators and WJC really believed it was constitutional, but because everyone voting on it was thinking of poll numbers and their re-election in 1, 3, or 5 years.

One thing that comes up a lot vis a vis the current gridlock is that the Senate is that they're there to 'put on the brakes', so irrational exuberance or fear doesn't end up dictating the law of the land. And that's true, in principle. But as things currently are, they're stomping on that brake not for real concerns over legality and/or the long term best interests of the country, but for the exact same baldly political agendas championed in the house. As is, the senate isn't serving a useful purpose in the process... It's just like House+. I think a different system of election/appointment could create a more distinct and useful role for it.

We have fully political representation in the House.  If those 51% are really on the right side, the laws that come out of the house should stand up to a less political Senate and an apolitical judiciary.  If not, maybe we just need to check ourselves, you know?  Remember when we reelected Bush?  51% is a terrifyingly easy majority to achieve through manipulation and fearmongering.

Yeah, that is what happened. So we spent months and months debating a bullshit law, and hundreds of legislative hours passing it.

This is exactly how it follows, actually. It isn't robert's job to re-write obamacare and change the ""penalty"" to a ""tax"".

I do agree with this. But hard is not impossible, as removing a lifetime appointment is. I also think that the reason amendments are rare is because no one bothers to try and do something hard when suing and hoping judges find loopholes for you is so much easier.

&gt;Calling someone who supports redistribution a socialist, I can maybe see, but honestly in the US even that's a little more extreme..

I can't disagree enough. For some reason people who push socialist or communist ideas insist you can't call those ideas socialist or communist because it is insulting to them. But they are not insults, they are descriptions of political philosophies. The idea that a person needs to demand a full take over of the private sector in one day in order to be called a socialist or communist is, in my opinion, a semantic argument at best. And by setting some kind of arbitrary limit on the conversation like ""You can't use socialist or communist"" seems to me to not only be unfair but also stifling to conversation.

Regardless of how annoyed we might be with our current government, it bears no resemblance to either fascism or communism, and we betray a severe lack of perspective by using those terms so cavalierly.

I think ""Racist"" ""Xenophobic"" ""Homophobic"" and many more like it are used far mote cavalierly today. You seem to be towing the line with your commentary here, and I understand why to an extent. Just labeling something ""Communist"" or ""Socialist"" or ""Fascist"" without explaining why you are calling it that is an issue, I agree. But I also agree that there are many levels involved and that the terms cover a spectrum not a narrow band of behavior.

&gt;Also, where did I say I voted for Obama?

My mistake then. I thought you said you voted for him the second time. I respect a Johnson vote, as well as an Obama vote or a Romney vote.

The bold part isn't really true, and it affects the meaning of the second sentence. For starters, presidents are elected with a whole history of public (and sometimes, private) actions and interactions behind them. Even when newly elected, a president stands for *something*, whatever that may be, even if only policy goals. Protests at an inauguration really are directed at the new president and what they stand for, not particularly towards the direction of the political system.

If you recall, those protests were largely organized by women's rights groups, and this was hot on the heels of Trump's ""grab them by the pussy"" remarks, not to mention the loss of the Democratic appointment of the Supreme Court (which always raises the possibility of perhaps reversing Roe vs Wade), and the overall way in which Trump conducted his campaign (among other things, appearing at times to encourage the use of violence against political opponents, protesters, the press, etc). There were plenty of reasons to protest *Trump*. 

&gt;The folks that protested in 2000, 2004, and 2016 weren’t protesting in 2008 so it’s clearly not about the system. It’s about the results.

In 2000, many Democrats decided they didn’t like losing and protested the decision that our society had come up with. In 2004 and in 2016 they decided to protest it again. And in 2004 Bush won the popular vote so it clearly wasn’t about the popular vote discrepancy.

They did not protest the 2008 and 2012 inaugurations so it’s hard to justify that it had anything to do with the process. They were fine with the process when their guy won. 

If we can’t even be civil on a day that used to just be a ceremony celebrating our proud history of peaceful transfers of power then how can we be civil about anything in politics.

That’s what an election is for. Even our most popular presidents had 1/3 of the population oppose them. Elections make it quite clear there are concerns/displeasure.

Two examples that come to mind is a freshman republican congressman shook Obama's hand, and that image was used against him in his primary to get him kicked out. Since then, Republicans freaked out and locked down hard on the no-contact rule with Democrats. Another is McCain, what incentive does he have to be less partisan? A ranking rank and file Republican openly criticising the party leader, Trump, is a HUGE DEAL, yet Democrats still bash him for not doing enough. 

And I agree, I hear it a lot. A ton actually... That Trump supporters are racist nazi uneducated white trash (Why else would they vote for Trump?). On this site it's constant. Some believe that Trump is literally a fascist trying to destroy America and anyone who supports him is literally supporting the equivalent of Hitler during his rise.","&gt;No, they really did talk a lot more.

&gt;That Trump supporters are racist nazi uneducated white trash (Why else would they vote for Trump?). On this site it's constant.

Yes, at the level of Youtube comments people name call. What is said much more often though, and much more sincerely, is that ""Your reasons for voting for Trump all pale in comparison to the fact that you voted for a racist demagogue who promised war crimes and bragged about sexual assault, whose stated heroes are all dictators and who openly threatens the press for criticizing him."" That's why you hear so many people sarcastically say ""But her emails!"" because every single transgression attributable to Clinton has already been committed by Trump, and then he adds on his particular brand of awfulness.
&gt;Some believe that Trump is literally a fascist trying to destroy America

I don't think he's trying to do anything but line his own pockets, but he *is* a fascist. Obviously people define the words differently but in the way that Stalin, Mao, Pinochet and others were fascists, he is too. That doesn't mean that ""Trump is literally Stalin"", because no one is actually saying that. What they're saying, and I've been *very careful to read specifically because I'm very keen on this conservative argument*, is that Trump's rhetoric is virtually identical to early dictator rhetoric, which is *uniquely* dictator rhetoric.",2013,70,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics
"B: &gt; As cronyist political insiders go, I give Hillary a 5/10. 

Dude, the Clinton's ARE the Democratic party. They have a reputation for taking care of everyone really well who's shown to be an ally and get them to the top.

&gt; She hasn't made hundreds of millions off Wall Street. Her charity has made maybe that much but she's prevented from using that money for personal gain.

Remember... I'm just explaining how they feel about. You can argue the details all day, but from their perspective what they believe is she's a crook.

She definitely made a lot personally. I think their networth is 400m, a little under half of which came from speaking fees for she and Bill and many of which were from special interests like wall street and other large multinationals (much of which happened while she was actively involved with politics - That's the big issue here).  We have to separate the different types of crook we have. Trump came right around a time when people were really really wanting an outsider, money in politics was to blame for a lot of problems, and so on... They can see Trump's shadiness but it's not directly tied to politics. 

They can look at Trump and his shadiness and think, ""Well yeah... He's a businessman. Sometimes you are going to step on toes. But ultimately he just ripped off some other rich dudes."" That's how they view it... But then they see Clinton, and they think ""Oh she took money straight from big corporations for 'speaking' fees while in office. She didn't just rip off some corporations, but she's doing it at the expense of the USA as a whole!"" This is the big issue with Clinton. The perceptions is that she just ripped off the American people. That she's a crook willing to sell out the country. Perception-wise, Trump doesn't have that with his supporters. He's seen as a rich guy who doesn't need money any more and maybe ripped off some other elite rich dudese in the past. But ultimately loves America.

&gt; The idea that Trump is just an abrasive NYC talking playboy. He bragged about sexual assault, he has had settlement after settlement for accusations of racism in his businesses and sexual harassment

This is one where I even fall flat on, and kind of side with their perception on. The dude talked about being rich and powerful and how women like rich famous dudes, so much so that you can practically walk up and grab their pussy. I don't think most people are going to act shocked if a famous rich dude openly admits what we all know ""Women like famous powerful rich men"". So again, that's going to fall flat for them.

Same with the Muslim thing. Conservatives reject the idea of multiculturalism. It's not that they are racist (even though the left tries to wedge them into being labeled that.) they just like their culture, way of life, and so on, and don't want to be bothered changing the way they live and have lived, for some outsiders. Muslim immigrants are pretty much the anti-thesis for conservatives. Islam is dangerous, sexist, and has a pretty violent recent history. So to conservatives, it's not so much that they are racist against brown people, just that they don't want that culture in America. 

&gt; No, it's him installing people who do not believe in the job they have so that he can parcel out regulatory capture to rich buddies, like with the EPA for example, and dismantling the CFB.

Again, from their perspective it's just your words. How do you know they are trying to engage in regulatory capture? Yeah, he's tearing down some institutions from within. He LITERALLY campaigned on doing that. Going in and shuffling up government to more align with your political philosophy (small government conservatism) is not fascism. 

&gt; They didn't threaten the press for criticizing him

I think this is the left's own doing for being really intellectually dishonest through the campaign. While I think 90% of what's reported is legit, much of it is partisan spin, and it's allowed for him to create a fake news narrative. But everyone of his supporters knows this. It's his politicking of defending himself from a press, which, is really really aggressive with him. But again, would classify it as facist. I'd put it into that category when it moves beyond rhetoric and into actually jailing and punishing the press... Which he has no intention in doing. He loves the press in secret because he knows how to play them like an instrument and spread his message.","&gt;Remember... I'm just explaining how they feel about. 

I agree. What they feel about it is only sustained in willing ignorance of the facts, and a cultivated distrust in experts.
&gt;This is one where I even fall flat on, and kind of side with their perception on.

I don't know how I can say this without being abrasive, but your response is basically excuses and downplays. Here:
&gt;Same with the Muslim thing. [...] So to conservatives, it's not so much that they are racist against brown people, just that they don't want that culture in America.

So why were the Phillipines not on the ban list?  Literally where most Muslims in the world live. Why is Saudi Arabia not on the list for that matter? Even if they were, how does that make them not racist? ""It's not that they're bigoted against another group, it's that they want to make it legal to discriminate against that other group"" is playing fast and loose with *words*. I don't really *care* that my grandfather doesn't like black people, I care that he *discriminates* against them, that he takes actions against them on the basis of their race. That's what *counts*. This is leaving out Trump's actual history of racial discrimination, not just against Mulsims.

Sure, fine, *whatever*, it *doesn't actually matter*. The left and right wings of our press corps have been precisely as low-content and sorry as they are now for about 12 years. Under both regimes of party, no one acted like *every historical dictator* towards them. You don't need to tell me why Trump doesn't like the press in general. No politician should ever like the press in general, *if the press is doing their job*.

Clinton showed how that can be done. 

In Germany all the more libertarian economists have gone into hiding or doubled down. Which is weird, because they occupy all the important advisory boards and most universities.

I don't think that's a fair generalization.  It would be akin to saying it's hard to believe anyone advocates central economic planning after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  (Obviously both situations are more nuanced than that.)

It'll take a while to understand the true impact of 2008 and, in the end, everybody isn't going to agree.   People who are less optimistic about the free market will look at it &amp; say it clearly demonstrated the problems of an open market, lack of regulation, etc.  People more favorable will point out banking is anything but a free market, given the already heavy regulation.

1. The formation of the crises as illustrated by numerous authers such as Michael Lewis in ""The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine"" nicely illustrates how some basic premises of libertarian economic theory are false. For example that people act rational. It's also a nice example of some forms of market failure.

Let's talk about the 2008 crisis:

- The Fed actively blew up a housing bubble, which was at the start cheered on by people like Krugman. &lt;--- Government interference.

- The government guaranteed riskly loans and what amounted to no-loss gambling on Wall Street, as the government promised to bail out bad loans. &lt;--- Government interference.

- Back in 2004, Ron Paul, a strong free-market ally, said that the loans given to Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae would blow up, resulting in a credit crisis. He cited Austrian business cycle theory with regard to the cheap credit given by the Fed. &lt;--- Free-market person warns about crisis in great detail.

- After it became apparent that gross fraud had been commited, the government then prosecuted almost no one, and bailed out the corrupt companies ensuring that not only are the trouble makers not punished, but they get to keep their cushy six-figure jobs. &lt;--- government supporting those who fucked up.

Basic free market theory, for example, has the premise that people are rational. But they are not. Which is one of the major problems. So you can't even explain what is happening. And even if they were rational, there are at least four completely independant ways of so called [market failure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure).

That would mean anarchy. 

You know one of the huge problems associated with the crisis over here in Germany was/is the failure of democracy. A lot of the actions were interpreted as not democratic. That politics lost their primacy to large companies, which started to make their own laws. The will of the people, democracy, lost and we slipped a little way into a kleptocracy more akin to China or Russia.

If the people stop holding absolute power, freedom will end. Which is actually an opposite position to libertarianism, IMHO. So a firm economic policy, with respect to a free and fair market, can be very libertarian. Instead of a blind believe that market forces are good or work. It's not only monopolies but also market failure (in multiple ways) that prevent that from happening.

I have a strong feeling that you seem to disregard the concept of market failure, which has become pretty basic economics these days. It's about as proven as free market theory. As anything economic can be proven. Or not, as it turns out.

That would fall under external effects.

&gt; What does that even mean? Who get's to say what best even means? Just because you don't like the outcome, doesn't mean it's therefore objectively bad. 

That's an interesting thought. You see, I believe there is an objective better and worse. For example: If I can, right now, make €10 profit by killing a million people or a €5 profit by doing something that won't kill them, I believe one of them is objectively surperior. Unlimited free markets and a sociopath (which is pretty much what happened in 2008) beg to differ. And you can go less than my grossly overstated example to ""putting 10 tons of CO2 in the air"" vs. ""putting 2 tons of CO2 in the air"". I am just talking about external effects right now. Which is just one example of market failure. Completely independent of the others (like information asymmetry). Because there is not one market failure, but several.

"A: I don't think this discussion would be complete without including the particular [form of Islam](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saudi/analyses/wahhabism.html) that powerful petro-states like Saudi Arabia are [exporting](http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/saudi-connection-wahhabism-and-global-jihad) around the globe.

I'd argue that the real root of domestic radicalization is simply young Muslims going to these mosques and madrassahs and becoming radicalized.

After all, the perpetrators of the San Bernandino attacks were not destitute [as far as I can tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack#Rizwan_Farook)","&gt; How important is the threat of ""home-grown"" Islamic terrorism compared to foreign threats?

The threat of foreign fighters is [greatly exaggerated](http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2015/01/western-foreign-fighters-in-syria-and-iraq-byman-shapiro). Home-growth terrorists are a far greater threat than foreign terrorists for few reasons. First, these individuals have a far better understanding of the local terrain (human and physical) than a foreigner and can easily blend in with the population. They understand the language and culture, they know nuances of the locations they are operating in, and they have social ties and networks (family, friends, colleagues) that they can rely upon. Second, a foreigner has to go through security that a local does not, such as at border crossings and checkpoints. Additionally, a citizen of the country is less likely to come under scrutiny when leaving and returning than a foreign is when they enter for the first time. From a purely logistical perspective, it is easier to radicalize a resident from the country a foreign terrorist organization wishes to target than it is to send a resident from another country or send back a foreign fighter from that country. 

&gt; What is the true cause of domestic radicalisation?

This is a very difficult question to answer. Scholars have been trying to answer the question of ""why someone becomes a terrorist"" for decades now. Despite millions of dollars in government funding and untold man hours spent researching the topic, [there still is no good answer](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/world/europe/mystery-about-who-will-become-a-terrorist-defies-clear-answers.html). Since the [1970s](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/notes/2007/N1300.pdf), social scientists have been trying to develop a rubric for what makes a person a terrorist, with no success. Although they are generally able to mind commonalities between those who engage in terrorism, the characteristics that these individuals share are not unique to them. The individual motivations and personality factors are too diverse to develop a usable model. 

That said, there are a number of generalizable characteristics that terrorists share that are important to keep in mind when trying to understand why people become radicalized. Applying these characteristics to specific individuals will not always be accurate; think of them more as trend lines rather than specific data points. 

**1)** Terrorism is also motivated by a strong sense of altruism, albeit one that is misguided. For people engaging in terrorism, it is a means to greater end. They see themselves engaging in violence on behalf of some constituency--such as a religion, ethnic group, political ideology, etc--with a sense of self-righteousness and self-sacrifice (i.e. ""I fight so that my ____ can do/be ____""). Additionally, many terrorists state that they did not want to use violence, but were given no other alternative (this is their perception, not reality). They see themselves as reluctant warriors. Although it is rare for individuals, the group will state that their use of violence is just and legitimate. They will point to the alleged ""crimes"" of their enemy and state that they are matching their enemy's violence in kind. However, these individuals lack the power to change the system through non-violent means, either because their views are unpopular or the political system doesn't allow it. Therefore they engage in terrorism, as it is the only means at their disposal, which is why terrorism is called a tool of the weak). The terrorists will use violence to bring attention to their cause, with the goal of gathering recruits and support and placing pressure against the target of their attacks. This is a phenomenon called ""propaganda by deed,"" and has been an element in every terrorist's strategy since the advent of modern terrorism.

**2)** Social networks are a hugely important element when it comes to joining a terrorist organization. Individuals are more likely to join an organization their relatives or friends are already members, as those members can both advocate for the terrorist group and its ideology. For example, six active members of one of the best [soccer clubs in Hebron became suicide bombers](http://www.newsweek.com/jihad-soccer-club-139565). Terrorists will also frequently join in groups, where they encourage each other to join an organization that none of the them would have likely joined on their own. In this case, the individuals continue to push each other further in their beliefs and actions until they become willing to engage in terrorism. The [D.C. Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.C._Five) is one example of this, and it appears that the two bombers in the Brussels attack were as well. Once a part of a terrorist organization, the values of the group and the decision to use terrorism is continually reinforced by group-think and group dynamics. This is further exacerbated by the covert nature of terrorist groups, as critical dissent is discouraged by other members. Similar psychological processes occurs here on Reddit (though without the violence) when users in subreddits consistently upvote material they agree upon, while downvoting anything that deviants from the accepted narrative (i.e. a circle jerk).  

**3)** There is often a catalyst event for each terrorist that is pivotal to their radicalization. Usually this kind of event is an attack on their constituency by a real or perceived enemy. This event can be personal--such as abuse someone suffered from an authority--or it can be a public and widely seen event--like a military intervention into a foreign country. But this catalyst can also be a personal and intimate crisis. It can be economic (losing a job, feeling blocked from economic mobility), personal (death in the family, family conflict, feelings of victimization), or social/cultural (racism, feelings of marginalization or social humiliation). These crises create what psychologists call a ""[cognitive opening](http://insct.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Wiktorowicz.Joining-the-Cause.pdf)"", whereby an individual becomes receptive to the possibility of new ideas and worldviews. It is during this time when the individual will be more receptive to material that can lead them down the path of radicalization. Of course, this is hardly a perfect indicator of whether someone would be a terrorists; the same events that may drive one to terrorism can spur someone to do charity or serve their country. 

&gt; What are the most effective methods of preventing such radicalisation?

Unfortunately, it is really difficult to say. However, as you can likely see from the paragraphs above, radicalization is related far more to social and psychological elements that religious ones, many of which can be hidden to authorities, community leaders, or even close family and friends. As John Horgan states, ""an attempt to help an individual reinterpret hadiths is far less important than understanding the meaning of their involvement, the factors that mobilized them into action in the first place, and what led to their disengagement."" Any radicalization program or deradicalization program needs to take these elements into consideration. 

We have already seen success from some deradicalization programs such as the one in [Saudi Arabia](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/persian-gulf/2010-05-01/getting-deradicalization-right). The Saudi program adopts a holistic approach that deals not only with countering radical ideology, but also deals with the psychological and social issues that facilitated the radicalization. Families play a very important role in deradicalization and the individuals in question are often given [vocational training and therapy](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/saudi-de-radicalization-center-uses-art-therapy-tackle-extremists-n299246). The result is a program that gives its participants optimism for their future. Although the program has been fairly successful (less than 20% of participants return to terrorism), it still has a lot of room for improvement. 

But Some people cannot be de-radicalized. They may believe so so thoroughly in their cause that their minds cannot be swayed. According to Jerrold M. Post, ""the terrorist whose only sense of significance come from being terrorists cannot be forced to give up terrorism, for to do so would be to lose their very reason for being."" For these individuals, removing them from society (one way or another) may be the only option.",263,11,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

I get what you mean, and I think it's very important to realise that terrorists are misguided 'trying to do the right thing' in their own messed up world-view, rather than the untrue cop-out of just framing them as 'evil', or psychopaths bent on destruction.

But I think 'idealistic' is more accurate than 'altruistic'; yes, they think they are making the tough decisions for the greater good, but the willingness to sacrifice others, imo, betrays the fact that, even in the terrorist's mind, these are not really 'altruistic' acts, generally.

We have a majority of complaints about gerrymandering and voter disenrollment by Republicans, and yes there have been instances of it being done by Democrats also, but the vast majority of the complaints are being done by Republicans by far.

  


I also like to point out that one side has used and continues to use Cambridge Analytical (or whatever their newest daughter company is called as the all have the same key members) that have been caught on tape by BBC reporters bragging about the lengths they will go to including highly illegal means to skew public opinion, that same company that is being investigated by multiple countries at this very time for illegal practices.

  


Then we have also seen a rise of overt racism, and the GOP embracing many of these candidates, along with the daily demonization of brown people by the president himself.

  


So in my opinion the idea of a middle is all fine and good as long as both sides are keeping the rhetoric between a 3 and 7 on a scale from 1 to 10, but the absolute amount of outright lies and deception by the Republicans are at at least a 9 or 10 on that scale currently, and even when confronted with facts of their dishonesty, we have them doubling down with admitted ""alternative facts"" yet no one is held accountable. Remember that ""alternative facts"" is an Republican invention, brought to the mainstream by Republicans, and is outright lies in the face of facts.

Ok, so Russia is the arms partner for Assad.  This means that Russia has influence in Syria because Assad can't be Assad without arms and Russian arms are the arms he gets.

I think it's self evident that Russia is concerned about any regime change because it adds uncertainty to their influence.  

EDIT:  [this comment - u/Arguss gives a detailed and substantiated examination of US interest in Syria](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1lw8yg/why_does_the_president_seem_so_personally/cc432ts) just got bestof'd.

","A lot of people just don't know anything about what is really going on in the news.  They see headlines on their social media feeds, maybe on the homepage of their mail site, and the occasional link on reddit or a headline on a newspaper or magazine in passing.  Outside that few seem to care to go beyond the surface and learn about what's going on.

I was visiting a friend the other day and asked them what they thought about some current events and I was surprised that an intelligent and educated person such as her just absorbed headlines but knew little outside that.  With jobs, bills, school, and other life concerns its not too hard to see why many don't put in the time, but it can be concerning that these are the same people who vote for public officials.

To answer your question though, Russia's (and therefor Putin's) only real interest is to maintain a profitable political and economic relationship with the Assad government.  It helps that he can poke the West in the eye while he's at it.  I don't think he wants to see Syria using chemical weapons, but they don't control Assad, and the only pressure they could assert would mean loss in business.

Also, its true that US citizens don't want to go into Syria, but its false to think that the US government (Obama, the military, congress, etc) want to go in as well.

All I've been able to find is that trump has quadrupled the amount of strikes.

"B: You take away all of their safehavens so they have no place to train, recruit and plan their attacks. You kill them with boots on the ground. Trained forces that can be more precise than bombs dropped from orbit.

At the same time you use these trained and accountable military forces to stabilize the countries that they thrive in. They always thrive in a failed unstable state like Libya or Syria or with the blessing of brutal dicatatorships.

You also use these trained and accountable forces to help create a democratic government by ensuring free and fair elections, rebuild infrastructure, and support and defend that democracy until it can raise it's own army and police force.

You can then have your foreign trained and accountable military forces stand down as the local trained and accountable military forces stand up. As those failed states become democracies, there are fewer and fewer safehavens for the terrorist to hide in, train in and recruit from.

Until there are none.

It takes some time, and you are right it is not easy. But the end result is democracy in the place of totalitarian dictatorships and hope for the locals rather than no alternative but to obey the people beheading everyone in the town square. And it is the only path there.

When we bomb the place from orbit, or hand out weapons to untrained and unaccountable civilian militas - and then brag about how much money we saved by not restoring order in the country... we end up with ISIS setting up shop in Syria, branching out to Libya... and no democracy or stability in either state is anywhere on the horizon. Not after 6 years... When really, they should be finally coming around the corner and voting and have their own democracy and military and police forces in training by now.

So when I look at the article and the texts, it seems [Redacted] is actually McCabe. So here are 3 FBI agents implicated in being sources for news leaks, and also hiding that foreknowledge from other FBI agents on their team.

If I can do this sitting at my desk, what the hell is the FBI's problem?

"A: The FBI hired Steele, then fired him for lying - what does that have to do with any charges against the president? It seems to me you are stretching for a reason why the law isn't being applied equally.

&gt;Everything else is just speculation.

I disagree. There is plenty of public evidence available, and anyone paying attention knew about the Flynn phone call almost around the moment it happened. I mean, it was a call in december and another days before the inauguration, and here is the news article in the WaPo on January 23, 2017.. seems like insta-leak.

The only perspective that seems to be speculation continues to be the Manchurian Candidate arguments, in my opinion. 

Not only does the Nunes memo say that Steele lied to the FBI, so does the Senate:

It's only starting now for some reason - when this information has been readily available for over a year? or more? by the FBI themselves?

What is Mueller doing? Why isn't this in the never-ending scope of his authority?

It's really mindboggling, and it is too bad there is no way to ask why this is just being ignored in his investigation.

A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, it was apparently common for the self-superior Jedi to evade law enforcement by [using the force on the ""weak minded.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO_xfR64qSk) This put them at an advantage over regular citizens who were subject to the laws of the land, but some people gave them a pass, because the Jedi were seen as righteous defenders of peace.

On present day earth, is it ethical to use these powers to subvert the will of the people by [manipulating law enforcement officers?](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/s4nv2/my_jedi_skills_got_me_out_of_a_traffic_ticket/) It would seem to give the folks with these powers an unfair advantage, but on the other hand, perhaps the state has gotten too powerful and the order must rise again to protect democracy.

","1. Being the big fish in a trade agreement has geopolitical advantages. Instead of threatening countries with costly military action, you can just use sanctions. This becomes more true in our modern age where militarism and civilian casualties are a much bigger concern than they were in the past. Warfare is (and is becoming) much less explicit than in the past. It's about plausible deniability and economic warfare at this point.

2. Building on point 1, this also strengthens the cooperation between countries. China and the US are basically competing to add people to their economic coalitions. Since China is a big country, the only way to offset that power (assuming you even feel the need to offset that power is necessary) is to build a coalition of smaller countries. Up until recently these smaller countries like Vietnam, Korea, Japan, Phillipines, etc. were all fighting each other which made it easier for China to divide and conquer.

3. Chinese labor costs are rising quick, and Western countries need more sources of cheap labor. Trade and development deals can provide this cheap labor. And when those countries are developed in a few decades, the focus will shift to Africa. There is never an end to this until the whole world is developed.

4. This will be bad for many low to mid level US workers because more industries and businesses will move some operations overseas (or not move them back since Chinese labor costs are up). At first, just the manufacturing is moved and US companies have to babysit these factories to make sure the quality and logistics are there. Later, the factories become more self-sufficient and start to reproduce existing Western products on their own accord, which they then sell to Western companies. Western companies like this because the risk and investment is less for them. Even later, these Chinese companies start to innovate and then skip the Western companies entirely and start to directly market to Western consumers. We are not to that stage yet.

5. Costs will decrease or at least not increase as much as they otherwise would have, and there will eventually be more competition and interesting products on the market. 

6. More US exports in agriculture and other areas mean those corporate subsidies are likely to decrease or be eliminated and those funds will be shifted towards programs for the poor. If the US can export more food to more people, then the price of food for US workers will also rise but the price of food in non-US countries will decrease.",11756,30,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

Round 1: Japan wants to protect its rice industry and the US wants to protect its auto industry. The negotiators meet and discuss lifting tariffs on these products.

NAFTA and the EU are considered to be success stories for North Americans and Europeans.

&gt;It should be noted that England stayed out of the Eurozone. That is an important thing to pay attention to - when the countries that help initiate something do not hold themselves to the same tenets/ideals/rules/currency.

They're in the EU but didn't want to trade the Pound for the Euro. They did this in part because they didn't need the protection offered by tying their currency to the German currency.

&gt;But I do know that trade deals have made things much worse economically for the average global citizen.

"A: &gt; NAFTA and EU are seen as a success by some - yes, perhaps the people who benefit would say so.

I should clarify that both are seen to have provided greater benefits than costs to the states who have joined these treaties.

&gt; Fair enough about England, but they are also wise to have done so.

The question is were the others wise to have done so. Arguably it was a good idea, implemented badly.

&gt; Agreed. Trade agreements are there to benefit member states. And that is the problem - partially because the ones with influence in those member states are powerful banks and corporations.

~~Banks and corporations are not evil - they are simply legal constructions. People who exploit others to the extent that they have IS indeed evil, but just about any measure...except the morals of the people doing the exploiting and their supporters.~~

Let's leave ""evil"" and ""morals"" aside here.

My own personal thinking on this is that this has been primarily a tax policy problem.

We've used the power of the State Department to negotiate these trade treaties and the corporations have profited handsomely, but when they try to bring back their profits they realize that they are required to pay a high tax rate (the quid pro quo). So they willingly forget that they owe Americans those tax dollars, and claim that their huge profits overseas are due to their own entrepreneurial genius. 

So now you have trillions of dollars in corporate profits hiding overseas that should be redistributed amongst Americans, especially Americans that lost their jobs because of globalization, but that isn't happening. If it did, all Americans would benefit from those trade deals.

The problem, then, isn't the economic ideas behind global trade deals, it's the politics of their implementation. Congress has to demand corporations pay their taxes but one Party thinks all taxes are bad, so they can't in good conscience do that. ",(pass),11756,78,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

"B: From Kevin Carson's [At Reason, War is Peace … and TPP is “Free Trade”](https://c4ss.org/content/41012):

&gt; . . . such agreements are the direct opposite of free trade. They create a net increase in protectionism. The reduction of tariffs and other barriers to the movement of goods across national borders is only secondary, if not incidental. Their purpose, rather, is to drastically increase the form of protectionism most central to the dominant corporate business model today: So-called “intellectual property.” The draconian IP provisions of contemporary “free trade” treaties serve the interests of global corporations the same way high industrial tariffs served American corporations a century ago.

&gt; . . .

&gt; These treaties, by facilitating the movement of means of production across borders, enable corporations to contract production to independent sweatshops in low wage countries, pay them $2 for a pair of sneakers, and import them for sale at Walmart for $200. And because patents and trademarks give them a monopoly on sale of the product, they’re protected against the independent contractors deciding to produce identical shoes and selling them for $10 on the local market.

&gt; In the early 20th century, when most industrial capital was national, Western countries’ main imports were raw materials from the colonial world and their main exports were finished industrial goods. So it was in the interest of American manufacturers to restrict competition in the domestic market from imported goods manufactured in other industrialized countries. Fast forward 100 years though, and most American imports are by the Western-owned global corporations themselves, importing goods produced under contract for them so they can sell them in the domestic market at an enormous “intellectual property” markup over the cost of production.

&gt; Since the movement of goods across borders is now mostly an internal affair of global corporations themselves, outmoded tariffs that impede the movement of goods have become an inconvenience. What they need, instead, is a form of protectionism that still gives them a monopoly over selling a particular product in a particular market — but operates at corporate boundaries rather than national ones. That’s what “intellectual property” does.

&gt; . . .

&gt; So what’s falsely called “free trade” today isn’t a decrease in protectionism. It’s a shift from one kind of protectionism that no longer serves corporate interests, to a new kind of protectionism that better serves them.",Thanks,11756,83,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

So wouldn't Putin exposing how he punked the world now be just as good as later? By showing Trump really is his puppet, wouldn't that be the best play for Putin and Russia?

If the FBI or CIA or NSA are the ones to ""Figure it out"" first, isn't that bad for Putin and Russia? Wouldn't it be more powerful if they were the ones to reveal it?

&gt;By not releasing it, he could still hold it over Trump in situations where Trump does have a say on what to do.

This seems to be proven untrue, if all congress needs to do is over-ride or pass legislation.

But I do agree with the first part - having dirt is having dirt and does have that advantage of blackmail...

It just also seems to me that the absolute chaos that a revelation like that would cause in the US at this moment in time would be something the US has not seen in modern history. So the benefit of playing the card while it has that value seems like a better ""move"" for Putin if Trump is Putin's Puppet.

Especially if Mueller and the FBI and CIA and NSA and Justice department are just about to make their move and break the whole case open to the world, gnome sane?

And of course, if Trump is in fact Putin's puppet - what does Putin care about holding it out long term over Trump?

Just a knee jerk example here, but since you're on reddit I hope it will resonate.

Look at the state of internet access in the United States. Our country literally invented the internet - we had *years* of a head start before anyone else had even begun to think of a concept, and yet right now we have one of the worst networks anywhere in the developed world.

Why is this? The answer is the same for any sort of telcom, from phone lines to wireless - and it's what you would probably deem compassion.

Because of the large geography of the US, telcoms have constantly been subsidized by our government. To the tune of not billions, but trillions of dollars just in our last major stimulus packages. These are usually passed on the basis of improving rural networks, but it's rare that this money reaches that exact source.

In the case of ISP's especially, the government socializes itself in another way. It forms *and protects* regional monopolies. The reasons for this policy is the same as those for a stimulus.

So the government eliminates competition, and also subsidizes the infrastructure of huge ISPs (almost *never* passing any money to the few local ISP's that manage to muscle their way into a municipality).

This is a mix of ""capitalism and socialism"", and it drives me mad because it's the worst sort collusion you can imagine. We ask government to both control and support corporations, and we wonder why it can't seem to do both.

Saying an agency must be reformed when it performs incorrectly is not the answer. The same people that demand the government create jobs also demand that these jobs have tenure and pensions.

But it's anything but cheap to produce and maintain. I think that over time, internet access will be available to everyone because it is so desirable.

I'd disagree that medicare (and medicaid, while we're talking about these things) fraud rates are solely the responsibility of politicians. Far from it.

In fact Medicare and Medicaid are examples of why social programs are difficult to implement. It's because people who are the beneficiaries of these programs also game the system.

- Subsidized College loans.  Ostensibly this is like a mini-GI bill, broad based, to encourage people of lesser means to get a college education.  We say that the world is information driven, that people will have a better chance to participate as productive citizens, if they are educated. Beyond which, a liberal education means a more stable populace, a more civil society. All good right?  

But then they made college loans untouchable in bankruptcy.  This means college loans are worth more than any other loan.  Not all loans are created equal. College tuition loans are untouchable, immortal.  In its wisdom the law allows crushing debt to be dispensed via bankruptcy, but not college loans.  And the logical consequence of that is that the cost of college will skyrocket. College costs go up, because of the economic law of subsidy: subsidizing anything makes it more expensive. The loans themselves are a subsidy, but the fact that they are not dismissable in bankrupcty is an extraordinary subsidy.  

- Subsidized corn. Sure, we need a secure food supply. But is the best way to do that, handing out billions of dollars to Monsanto and other mega corporations? Honestly? We subsidized corn ethanol for 30 years, when as long as 20 years ago it became very clear that the economics were upside down. And yet the congress continued handing out money. 

- Obama's Healthcare reform. What people really need is quality healthcare for a reasonable cost, but because of corporate influence in the congress, we got a system that essentially continues the status quo, and is not funded to deliver the benefits we wanted. 

- Bush's Medicare Prescription Drug benefit. A giant giveaway to old people in exchange for votes. We couldn't afford this when it was proposed, and we still can't.

- Iraq. Sure, we want global security, but invading a country and destroying all the infrastructure?  Essentially we paid people to blow crap up, then paid the same people to rebuild it.  The US military excursion into Iraq, aside from all the deaths of innocent people, has been a huge boondoggle for defense contractors and military consultants, Iraq is what President Eisenhower apochryphally warned us about when he decried the ""military industrial complex"" in his farewell address.

"B: &gt;the economic law of subsidy: subsidizing anything makes it more expensive

Wait, really? I thought subsidies were supposed to make prices go down for consumers.

Damn, economics, you scary.","yes really.

Subsidies are a form of market interference.  Sometimes they lower the cost to consumers. Sometimes they raise the cost to consumers.  Sometimes they are neutral to consumers.  But in all cases, subsidy raises the *net cost* for the subsidized good.  When I use the term subsidy, it refers to any kind of subsidy.

One form of subsidy is a tariff. For example, there's a tax on sugar imported from Brazil to the USA.  For real.  For every 100 lbs of sugar, the US government charges the importer, let's say, $10.  I don't know the actual number, but I know there's a real subsidy. Using our fake number, it means the seller/importer has to charge $10 more for that 100lbs of sugar, to make the same profit. In other words the tariff increases the net cost of the imported sugar. 

This is a form of subsidy for sugar produced domestically, in the USA.  Obviously this form of subsidy does not make sugar cheaper for consumers, right?  It makes imported sugar more expensive, and it thus allows domestic sugar to be priced higher, because it does not need to compete with the naturally cheaper imported sugar. So the effect of this subsidy is to make all sugar (imported as well as domestic) more expensive for everyone. 

Another form of subsidy is government assistance for purchases.  Think of subsidized government housing, available to lower-income people. If a person takes advantage of that subsidized housing, *they pay less for housing* than they might otherwise. On the other hand, the net cost of the housing goes up.  That's because the total cost is what the consumer pays, plus what the government pays.  The owner of the subsidized housing gets more money for the rental unit than he would in a completely free market, for the same property.  The full net cost of the subsidized good (rental housing) is not transmitted to the direct consumer; instead the extra cost is picked up by the taxpayer. Some portion of their taxes goes to paying the higher cost of the subsidized rent. net cost: up.  consumer cost: down. 

Another kind of subsidy is cheap money - subsidized loans that can be used only for particular purposes. FNMA and FMAC did this for housing loans.  The federally-supported school loans do this for college tuition.  The effect is that the ""cost of money"" to be used for a particular purpose is lower than it otherwise would be. One effect is that the thing being purchased is more accessible - more people can buy a house, or more people can go to college. But, another effect is that the cost of the thing being purchased with cheaper money - the house or the college tuition - goes up. There is more money chasing the same resource - houses or admission spots at Stanford - so the price of that good naturally goes up.  

Government-subsidized school loans allow more people to go to college, but the net cost of a college education goes up, as compared to a hypothetical free market, in which there are no govt-supported loans available. 

The other subsidy affecting college tuition loans is their exclusion from dismissal in bankruptcy.  That is a huge subsidy, which makes the book value of the loan much, much higher than it would be. Think of it this way: people default on some percentage of loans .  For argument's sake, let's say 1% of loans don't get paid back. This is a risk to lenders, and they use this credit default rate to figure the interest to charge for all loans.  The interest has to be enough to make up for expected losses from loan defaults. 

But the default rate for school loans is by law, 0%.  You cannot default. You cannot ever dismiss the loan.  So that means a loan of $10,000 for school tuition, is worth a lot more to a bank, than a loan of $10,000, in the form of a credit card balance, which can be dismissed in bankruptcy.  The fact that the loans never default encourages more lending for school loans; according to supply and demand, more school loan money pushes the cost of tuition up. 

----

Another form of subsidy - government payouts for particular things. Funny story: at one time the US Government established a policy to eliminate wolves from Yellowstone National Park. So what did they do?  They offered $10 per head of each wolf killed. Bring in a wolf head, get $10.  Bring in ten heads, get $100.  Guess what happened?  The population of wolves in the park skyrocketed.  Why?  Because what used to be worthless - the head of a dead wolf - was now worth $10.  This can be thought of as a direct subsidy for wolf heads.  Obviously the cost for wolf heads went up - from zero to $10.  And incidentally, because of the increased value (or price) of wolf heads, people began to raise wolves for profit, which means the population of wolves went up.  Oops.

**TL;DR**: Subsidy for a thing always increases the net cost of a thing, though that cost may not be passed directly to the consumer of the thing.  

- In the particular case of government-subsidized school loans, the effect is to increase the cost of a college education *for everyone,* whether they use a government-subsidized loan to pay for college or not. 

- In the particular case of subsidized home loans, the cost of a house goes up for everyone.  

- In the case of sugar tariffs, the cost of sugar goes up for everyone.  

- In the case of subsidized low-income rental housing, the cost of housing goes down for the consumer of the subsidized housing, and up for everyone else (via taxes).

This is a risk to lenders, and they use this credit default rate to figure the interest to charge for all loans.  The interest has to be enough to make up for expected losses from loan defaults. 

But the default rate for school loans is by law, 0%.  You cannot default. You cannot ever dismiss the loan.  So that means a loan of $10,000 for school tuition, is worth a lot more to a bank, than a loan of $10,000, in the form of a credit card balance, which can be dismissed in bankruptcy.  The fact that the loans never default encourages more lending for school loans; according to supply and demand, more school loan money pushes the cost of tuition up. 

----

Another form of subsidy - government payouts for particular things. Funny story: at one time the US Government established a policy to eliminate wolves from Yellowstone National Park. So what did they do?  They offered $10 per head of each wolf killed. Bring in a wolf head, get $10.  Bring in ten heads, get $100.  Guess what happened?  The population of wolves in the park skyrocketed.  Why?  Because what used to be worthless - the head of a dead wolf - was now worth $10.  This can be thought of as a direct subsidy for wolf heads.  Obviously the cost for wolf heads went up - from zero to $10.  And incidentally, because of the increased value (or price) of wolf heads, people began to raise wolves for profit, which means the population of wolves went up.  Oops.

**TL;DR**: Subsidy for a thing always increases the net cost of a thing, though that cost may not be passed directly to the consumer of the thing.  

- In the particular case of government-subsidized school loans, the effect is to increase the cost of a college education *for everyone,* whether they use a government-subsidized loan to pay for college or not. 

- In the particular case of subsidized home loans, the cost of a house goes up for everyone.  

- In the case of sugar tariffs, the cost of sugar goes up for everyone.  

- In the case of subsidized low-income rental housing, the cost of housing goes down for the consumer of the subsidized housing, and up for everyone else (via taxes).

"C: I personally think it has a lot to do with the connotation people simply have in their heads with the words they hear, and being a liberal has been denigrated for quite some time and even the liberals and progressives tend to shy away from being called such.

There's certainly plenty of distrust in the government and liberals are the de facto supporters of an active, robust government role in society, but when the framing of these basic terms such as conservative and liberal are established as almost being good and bad, realistic and naive, productive vs consumptive, people will naturally identify themselves as being the more positively identified term.  

I've also noticed it can be more difficult to articulate an effective point for liberal or progressive ideals or values, as they seem to stem from results of a purely values-based system of operation, seeking to correct a problem from the current status quo.  So there's layers to being able to communicate this message effectively to people who might not be thinking about it, such as first establishing a common value or system that is agreed upon.  Then move onto a potential pitfall of having such a simplistic view of that system, perhaps a method of exploiting it.  State how a mechanism might work to prevent or mitigate the damage done by this corruption of the system, and that a purely voluntary basis of participation of those operating in this system is not workable(such as those people not participating in this preventive measure are at a competitive advantage to those participating), and that therefore a law or policy must be established to either encourage or compel entities to adhere to this preventive measure.  State this is a possible approach to progressive/liberal thought and query how that is evil or stupid, and ask for input on how to prevent that being corrupted somehow.","&gt;being a liberal has been denigrated for quite some time and even the liberals and progressives tend to shy away from being called such

This is true, and I wonder how it became this way so easily. I believe that there is a slightly leftist bias in media (because it's a field that traditionally requires more education), so it's curious that the term ""liberal"" has such a negative connotation.

&gt;as they seem to stem from results of a purely values-based system of operation

I don't think this is necessarily a fair assessment of liberal vs. conservative ideas. I think most genuine political opinions stem from value systems, but when you get down to the bone of an argument sometimes it's the ONLY difference. For example, we *know* that socially and statistically, abortions are a ""good thing"". They result lower crime, give a safer environment for abortions that would happen anyway, and have the potential to save the lives of mothers with pregnancy complications. Why then, is there opposition to abortion? It's because some people value human life - even at an illogical stage of its existence - enough to ignore facts. My own discomfort with the morality of abortion stems from things other than its proven viability to society.

There's a difference between the freedom to abort a fetus, and establishing policies that demand participation by force. To defeat a law against abortion, all I have to do is prove that someone should be free to make a decision. To create a powerful (if not efficient) social safety net, I must not only demonstrate that it will be effective, but I must also compel someone who gains much less from a measure to support it with their livelihood. Those are the ""layers"" you're talking about, not the idea that only liberals have a correct sense of morality.",45,57,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics
"A: I agree that I probably glossed over some in my description of the two general directions of ideas in liberals and conservatives, though I disagree that all one has to do to defeat a law against abortion, for example, is to demonstrate it's effectiveness.  Besides the most fundamental view of thinking it shouldn't be allowed on the basis of it being immoral, the sometimes implied and sometimes outright idea of there being women who have multitudes of abortions underscores an idea that proponents of abortion are reckless in their sexual habits and are deferring their responsibility to both their baby as well as the state, costing both of those entities while enabling the woman who got the abortion to go out and continue behaving in the way they have been.  Especially in areas that identify very strongly with traditional values, these chip away and distract from the realities that those getting the procedure may very well not be in a financial or otherwise position to properly raise a child, may not be healthy enough to carry to term, or the oft-touted examples, while hopefully very rare in the overall number of abortions, rape victims.

On the hand, a social safety net could theoretically be proven with simply appealing to one's sense of equitability and charity if it is done in a way that appeals to the listener, but this is unlikely given the complexities of that argument as well.

I didn't mean to imply that only liberals have a correct sense of morality, and I apologize if it came off as high-handed or elitist because saying only one 'side' has a correct sense of morality is, indeed, a way of demonstrating some level of arrogance in one's own position.  What I meant to say in the progression part of my post was simply to engage with someone of a differing position so as to establish some common points of agreement and then to discuss how those commonalities break down on other points of discussion.  It very well may not, and probably won't lead to someone changing their opinion on things, but what it more likely can do will at least expose this person to a differing point of view in a way that is less offensive than having that same opinion misrepresented or caricatured by a person who actually doesn't even hold that opinion(such as, say, individuals like Glenn Beck or Sean Hannity presuming to speak for the values, motivations and goals of liberals or Keith Olbermann and Ed Schultz stating they know what lies in the hearts of conservatives).  Having an honest, nonaggressive exchange of ideas will better serve the participants than an increasingly tense atmosphere of arguing and attempting to establish superiority of morality or facts(which often can be taken out of context to be leveraged to one end or another).  It also, to me, fosters the sort of civil exchange of ideas, even if and especially if those involved don't come to agreement because a tenant of our representative systems is that we decide our current events and political disagreements with one another, not by ignoring and demonizing one another.  If it were not so, then why even establish a system which, at base, deals with having to contend with individuals of differing opinions?","&gt;I believe that there is a slightly leftist bias in media (**because it's a field that traditionally requires more education)**, so it's curious that the term ""liberal"" has such a negative connotation.

"B: &gt;A) this is correlational evidence, not causational. This distinction is very important.

I agree but I am unclear as to what you think this means. Does this mean we cannot use these studies to make an informed decision on gun control? Does this mean that the studies are correct but all it tell us is that these two things occurred at the same time and they have no or a very small relationship?

&gt;B) Even by proving the point of ""more guns do not stop more crimes"", this does not prove or give any real evidence to ""less guns do stop more crimes"", just anecdotal, correlational evidence.

The articles discuss studies that suggest that homes with guns had an increased risk of violence and suicide. I don't think it proves that fewer guns stop crime but that if you are around a gun the chances of being involved a crime that includes death increases.

&gt;The belief that more guns lead to fewer crimes is founded on the idea that guns are dangerous when bad guys have them, so we should get more guns into the hands of good guys. Yet Cook, the Duke economist, says this good guy/bad guy dichotomy is a false and dangerous one. Even upstanding American citizens are only human—they can “lose their temper, or exercise poor judgment, or misinterpret a situation, or have a few drinks,” he explains, and if they're carrying guns when they do, bad things can ensue. In 2013 in Ionia, Mich., a road rage incident led two drivers—both concealed carry permit holders—to get out of their cars, take out their guns and kill each other.

What did you think of this claim made in the article? Does the mix of accessible guns and alcohol/drugs play a role in these numbers? If we remove all the people who were high/drunk when they committed violent acts with guns do you think it would show that sober people make good choice with weapons even when they get emotionally upset?

&gt;And regardless of either of those points, if your goal is to stop crimes, and you believe getting rid of guns will help this, how will you make the population of Americans who want to have guns give them up? Will you perhaps advocate the use of force by police officers carrying guns?

&gt;And regardless of either of those points, if your goal is to stop crimes, and you believe getting rid of guns will help this, 

I don't think the suggestion is that we need to get rid of all guns. I think we need to have a honest discussion about who should have access to guns (all of the varieties available) and what types of modifications we should allow to be legal. I think we need a way to ensure those who have shown signs of recent mental issues cannot purchase military style firearms and maybe have to get permission from a guardian to be able to purchase other weapons. I don't really have all the answers on this issue but I think there is a path forward that enables most people to be able to legally purchase most weapons and still restrict those who have demonstrated unstable, criminal or terrorist behavior should be denied or have to wait much longer.

&gt;how will you make the population of Americans who want to have guns give them up? Will you perhaps advocate the use of force by police officers carrying guns?

This just seems alarmist to me. I have not heard anyone suggest that we need to force responsible gun owners to give up their legally owned weapons. I am sure that are some politicians out there that is saying this and I disagree with them. In my view the discussion is more about those who are abusing their right to own weapons than those who do it responsibly. We need to be discussing how to make it harder for some people without making it overly burdensome for majority of responsible gun owners out there. 

edit: grammar 
","In the event of trying to totally ban guns- I'd say deal with the already existing ones through buybacks and just wait it out. Over time with new guns being harder to get the number of total guns will go down. Many old guns will become unusable, not be maintained properly, be lost, be destroyed purposely by criminals b/c they are evidence or by law enforcement when they are discovered in a crime. Over time more will be sold as gun collections are passed on to people who would rather take some money, so as long as buybacks buy some of those guns for sale, and as long as laws make it so that getting a gun is prohibitively expensive and time consuming, the amount of guns will reduce over time without having to harass people with cops at every door.",2343,3,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics

"C: &gt;Only 9,616 were murders the rest were mostly suicides with a few accidents. Source FBI Expanded Homicide Data Table 8. That is some misleading shit. Suicidal people are still going to kill them selves or attempt to with or with out a gun.

This is categorically [not true](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-guns-in-home-increase-suicide-homicide-risk/). There is a reason why people choose guns for suicide, because the effect is instant, your body can't simply throw up a bullet, and it is much more immediate which means you have less chance to second-guess yourself. When you bring a gun into your home, it increases the risk of someone dying, *including yourself*.
&gt;So the gun murder per capita rate has significantly decreased over that 20 year period from 3.93 per 100,000 to 3.4 in 2016 (2.99 in 2015 the year in the article).

As all crime has decreased in the last 20 years, we would expect the gun numbers to go down. Instead, they have lagged behind the fall of other crimes' numbers, which is the point.
&gt;The Florida spree shooter was reported to 3 different government agencies before he attacked. The government systems in place failed miserably so how do more laws and more government help?

The laws failed because of people unwilling to enforce them. You think a young black male convicted on a minimum sentence of carrying marijuana gets the same leniency as a middle aged white guy buying a gun? People just assume it isn't a big deal, even though categorically and unequivocally white men commit the overwhelming amount of mass shooting incidents in this country, while black and white men consume relatively equal amounts of marijuana.
&gt;If a person has made their mind up to commit murder making it slightly harder to buy a gun won't stop them.

&gt;I am for a mental health disqualification from owning firearms but it must be a court mandated appearance not tried in abstention like the no fly list. Additionally this will require massive revisions of our health care and rights to privacy laws, including HIPPA.

I don't think disqualification is the right answer, I just think it should be harder. Maybe if you have had a mental health problem in the last 6 months you have to wait an additional 30 days or have a guardian sign off on the purchase. If you think the standard should be court mandated appearance then I think this would be a meaningless to stopping people. I guess the problem here is that if the bar is too low you stop to many people, but if you make it too hard then very few of the afflicted people will every get this certification so it will have little to no impact.

In my view this conversation is not strictly about murders.

If remove all the suicides from our discussion then we restrict our ability to try and stop a large number of deaths from occurring. 

&gt;Suicidal people are still going to kill them selves or attempt to with or with out a gun.

I don't believe this to be true, at least all of the time.

&gt; I have a major problem with this opening statistic, as suicides and murders should be looked at very differently.

I don't disagree that it would be useful to look at these things separately but nothing about including them together diminishes the information or conclusions presented in this article. 

&gt;I find it interesting the article doesn't quote gun murder statistics. Between 1997 to 2016 (as far as FBI statistics are listed online) total gun murders have ranged from 8,454 to 11,004. They don't follow a general pattern rising and falling several times in that 20 year period. However population of the US has greatly increased in that time, 272 million in 1997 to 323 million in 2016. So the gun murder per capita rate has significantly decreased over that 20 year period from 3.93 per 100,000 to 3.4 in 2016 (2.99 in 2015 the year in the article). Additionally, the number of firearms owned by private citizens has greatly increased during this time. NICS back ground checks for purchases of new firearms have gone from 9,138,123 in 1999 (earliest year listed online) to 27,538,673 in 2017. So there are more guns than ever before, higher population than ever before, but your chance of being murdered by a gun is decreasing steadily.

I think you want this article to be more narrowly focused then it actually is. I don't think think makes this article wrong or deceptive. I am going to assume that all of your numbers are correct. What do these numbers tell us about how to stop spree shootings in the US?

&gt;So I believe that this article intentionally misleads the reader in to assuming gun violence is growing, when gun murders per capita is shrinking. And this article seeks to conflate gun deaths (36,000 in 2015) with gun homicides (9,616 in 2015).

I don't think the author of the article claims that gun violence is growing in general. The article says:

&gt;But even as the belief that we are all future crime targets has taken hold, violent crime rates have actually dropped in the U.S. in recent decades. According to the FBI, rates were a whopping 41 percent lower in 2015 than they were in 1996. The NRA attributes this decrease to the acquisition of more guns. But that is misleading. What has increased is the number of people who own multiple guns—the actual number of people and households who own them has substantially dropped.

So the article acknowledges that violent crime rates have dropped in the US. It does suggest, as shown below, that states that have tried to make it easier for people to use their weapons in self deference have had increases in their homicide rates.

&gt;Recently researchers have tried to assess the value of self-defense gun use by studying “stand your ground” laws, which gained notoriety after teenager Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012. These laws allow people to kill in self-defense when they feel they are in danger. Progun groups argue that they should deter crime because criminals will know that victims have no reason not to fight back. But a January 2017 study reported that when “stand your ground” was passed in Florida, the monthly homicide rate went up by nearly a quarter. And a 2012 study found that states that adopted these laws experienced an abrupt and sustained 8 percent increase in homicides relative to other states. Mark Hoekstra, a co-author of the 2012 paper and an economist at Texas A&amp;M University, put it this way: “We found that making it easier to kill people resulted in more dead people.”

&gt;And a 2012 study found that states that adopted these laws experienced an abrupt and sustained 8 percent increase in homicides relative to other states. Mark Hoekstra, a co-author of the 2012 paper and an economist at Texas A&amp;M University, put it this way: “We found that making it easier to kill people resulted in more dead people.”

So the article claims that certain states have seen increases their in homicides after changing their laws to allow for more freedom to use weapons to in self defense, but on a national level violent crime has dropped.

&gt;The second part being very important because we have many laws that aren't currently enforced and safety protocols that aren't followed. The Florida spree shooter was reported to 3 different government agencies before he attacked. The government systems in place failed miserably so how do more laws and more government help?

I have heard this claim but I really don't know what this means. What laws are not being enforced and why are we not enforcing them? 

I think the questions should be how effective is our current system at stopping the sale of guns to people who have shown signs of intent to commit suicide or homicide. Can we stop more of these people while at the same time not stop people who have no such problems?

This is never going to be a perfect system that stops everyone all the time. If we can improve it to stop just a few more people then I think it is worth it.


&gt;If a person has made their mind up to commit murder making it slightly harder to buy a gun won't stop them. 

There is no such thing as a perfect system that stops every bad person but approves every good person. I just think we can improve on the system we have a bit. Realistically many people steal or own weapons prior to becoming mentally unstable. These rules won[t stop those people. I don't think this means we should not talk about improvements to the current system.

&gt;TL:DR We can discuss useful policy but this article conflates and misrepresents multiple issues involving firearms.

I think this article is broadly focused on guns and violence. I agree it could use better sourcing but I don't think is misrepresents or conflates the issues of murder and all gun violence. I would be open to continuing this discussion with another article of your choice. Maybe you can find one that is a bit more focus on the issue of murders rather than all gun violence. I do think that when we talk about changing the laws to restrict purchase to people with demonstrated signs of mental issues that we should include suicides in the discussion.

So the article acknowledges that violent crime rates have dropped in the US. It does suggest, as shown below, that states that have tried to make it easier for people to use their weapons in self deference have had increases in their homicide rates.

&gt;Recently researchers have tried to assess the value of self-defense gun use by studying “stand your ground” laws, which gained notoriety after teenager Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012. These laws allow people to kill in self-defense when they feel they are in danger. Progun groups argue that they should deter crime because criminals will know that victims have no reason not to fight back. But a January 2017 study reported that when “stand your ground” was passed in Florida, the monthly homicide rate went up by nearly a quarter. And a 2012 study found that states that adopted these laws experienced an abrupt and sustained 8 percent increase in homicides relative to other states. Mark Hoekstra, a co-author of the 2012 paper and an economist at Texas A&amp;M University, put it this way: “We found that making it easier to kill people resulted in more dead people.”

&gt;And a 2012 study found that states that adopted these laws experienced an abrupt and sustained 8 percent increase in homicides relative to other states. Mark Hoekstra, a co-author of the 2012 paper and an economist at Texas A&amp;M University, put it this way: “We found that making it easier to kill people resulted in more dead people.”

So the article claims that certain states have seen increases their in homicides after changing their laws to allow for more freedom to use weapons to in self defense, but on a national level violent crime has dropped.

&gt;The second part being very important because we have many laws that aren't currently enforced and safety protocols that aren't followed. The Florida spree shooter was reported to 3 different government agencies before he attacked. The government systems in place failed miserably so how do more laws and more government help?

I have heard this claim but I really don't know what this means. What laws are not being enforced and why are we not enforcing them? 

I think the questions should be how effective is our current system at stopping the sale of guns to people who have shown signs of intent to commit suicide or homicide. Can we stop more of these people while at the same time not stop people who have no such problems?

This is never going to be a perfect system that stops everyone all the time. If we can improve it to stop just a few more people then I think it is worth it.


&gt;If a person has made their mind up to commit murder making it slightly harder to buy a gun won't stop them. 

There is no such thing as a perfect system that stops every bad person but approves every good person. I just think we can improve on the system we have a bit. Realistically many people steal or own weapons prior to becoming mentally unstable. These rules won[t stop those people. I don't think this means we should not talk about improvements to the current system.

&gt;TL:DR We can discuss useful policy but this article conflates and misrepresents multiple issues involving firearms.

I think this article is broadly focused on guns and violence. I agree it could use better sourcing but I don't think is misrepresents or conflates the issues of murder and all gun violence. I would be open to continuing this discussion with another article of your choice. Maybe you can find one that is a bit more focus on the issue of murders rather than all gun violence. I do think that when we talk about changing the laws to restrict purchase to people with demonstrated signs of mental issues that we should include suicides in the discussion.

If these provisions cut the number of return visits to the ER by even a modest amount, the savings could be HUGE.  Only time will tell if they are, but this kind of push for better care and less re-admissions is just one of many provisions in the law aiming to reign in spending.

","1. Being the big fish in a trade agreement has geopolitical advantages. Instead of threatening countries with costly military action, you can just use sanctions. This becomes more true in our modern age where militarism and civilian casualties are a much bigger concern than they were in the past. Warfare is (and is becoming) much less explicit than in the past. It's about plausible deniability and economic warfare at this point.

2. Building on point 1, this also strengthens the cooperation between countries. China and the US are basically competing to add people to their economic coalitions. Since China is a big country, the only way to offset that power (assuming you even feel the need to offset that power is necessary) is to build a coalition of smaller countries. Up until recently these smaller countries like Vietnam, Korea, Japan, Phillipines, etc. were all fighting each other which made it easier for China to divide and conquer.

3. Chinese labor costs are rising quick, and Western countries need more sources of cheap labor. Trade and development deals can provide this cheap labor. And when those countries are developed in a few decades, the focus will shift to Africa. There is never an end to this until the whole world is developed.

4. This will be bad for many low to mid level US workers because more industries and businesses will move some operations overseas (or not move them back since Chinese labor costs are up). At first, just the manufacturing is moved and US companies have to babysit these factories to make sure the quality and logistics are there. Later, the factories become more self-sufficient and start to reproduce existing Western products on their own accord, which they then sell to Western companies. Western companies like this because the risk and investment is less for them. Even later, these Chinese companies start to innovate and then skip the Western companies entirely and start to directly market to Western consumers. We are not to that stage yet.

5. Costs will decrease or at least not increase as much as they otherwise would have, and there will eventually be more competition and interesting products on the market. 

6. More US exports in agriculture and other areas mean those corporate subsidies are likely to decrease or be eliminated and those funds will be shifted towards programs for the poor. If the US can export more food to more people, then the price of food for US workers will also rise but the price of food in non-US countries will decrease.",11756,30,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

Now, the lower wealth in other countries will mean that those countries will have much lower costs to the medications.  But generics will be limited, like in the US, leading to increased drug costs.

Edit for source of the drug prices rising elsewhere:

We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic. Your post or comment will be judged not by its perspective, but by its style, rationale, and informational content.

At this subreddit, we want to allow people who disagree on something to work it out between themselves in the interest of mutual understanding. If understanding truly cannot be reached (which is sometimes the case), we recommend that the conversation only continue as long both sides maintain decorum and feel that they are benefiting from the interaction. The mods will allow you to debate as long as it is civil, but sometimes it is best to part ways with a respectful “Good day, sir”. The choice lies in your good judgment.

Finally, try your best in a conversation to understand the other person’s perspective and determine rationally whether it makes sense. Take time to consider what they are saying. **Do not read a reply with the assumption that the other person is wrong**. Look for points that make sense and acknowledge them. Look for points that you can disprove and lay out your counterargument and evidence. Through this attitude, your discussion can be constructive and informative for both parties involved.

NAFTA and the EU are considered to be success stories for North Americans and Europeans.

&gt;It should be noted that England stayed out of the Eurozone. That is an important thing to pay attention to - when the countries that help initiate something do not hold themselves to the same tenets/ideals/rules/currency.

They're in the EU but didn't want to trade the Pound for the Euro. They did this in part because they didn't need the protection offered by tying their currency to the German currency.

"A: &gt; NAFTA and EU are seen as a success by some - yes, perhaps the people who benefit would say so.

I should clarify that both are seen to have provided greater benefits than costs to the states who have joined these treaties.

&gt; Fair enough about England, but they are also wise to have done so.

The question is were the others wise to have done so. Arguably it was a good idea, implemented badly.

~~Banks and corporations are not evil - they are simply legal constructions. People who exploit others to the extent that they have IS indeed evil, but just about any measure...except the morals of the people doing the exploiting and their supporters.~~

Let's leave ""evil"" and ""morals"" aside here.

My own personal thinking on this is that this has been primarily a tax policy problem.

We've used the power of the State Department to negotiate these trade treaties and the corporations have profited handsomely, but when they try to bring back their profits they realize that they are required to pay a high tax rate (the quid pro quo). So they willingly forget that they owe Americans those tax dollars, and claim that their huge profits overseas are due to their own entrepreneurial genius. 

So now you have trillions of dollars in corporate profits hiding overseas that should be redistributed amongst Americans, especially Americans that lost their jobs because of globalization, but that isn't happening. If it did, all Americans would benefit from those trade deals.

The problem, then, isn't the economic ideas behind global trade deals, it's the politics of their implementation. Congress has to demand corporations pay their taxes but one Party thinks all taxes are bad, so they can't in good conscience do that. ",(pass),11756,78,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

"B: From Kevin Carson's [At Reason, War is Peace … and TPP is “Free Trade”](https://c4ss.org/content/41012):

&gt; . . . such agreements are the direct opposite of free trade. They create a net increase in protectionism. The reduction of tariffs and other barriers to the movement of goods across national borders is only secondary, if not incidental. Their purpose, rather, is to drastically increase the form of protectionism most central to the dominant corporate business model today: So-called “intellectual property.” The draconian IP provisions of contemporary “free trade” treaties serve the interests of global corporations the same way high industrial tariffs served American corporations a century ago.

&gt; . . .

&gt; These treaties, by facilitating the movement of means of production across borders, enable corporations to contract production to independent sweatshops in low wage countries, pay them $2 for a pair of sneakers, and import them for sale at Walmart for $200. And because patents and trademarks give them a monopoly on sale of the product, they’re protected against the independent contractors deciding to produce identical shoes and selling them for $10 on the local market.

&gt; In the early 20th century, when most industrial capital was national, Western countries’ main imports were raw materials from the colonial world and their main exports were finished industrial goods. So it was in the interest of American manufacturers to restrict competition in the domestic market from imported goods manufactured in other industrialized countries. Fast forward 100 years though, and most American imports are by the Western-owned global corporations themselves, importing goods produced under contract for them so they can sell them in the domestic market at an enormous “intellectual property” markup over the cost of production.

&gt; Since the movement of goods across borders is now mostly an internal affair of global corporations themselves, outmoded tariffs that impede the movement of goods have become an inconvenience. What they need, instead, is a form of protectionism that still gives them a monopoly over selling a particular product in a particular market — but operates at corporate boundaries rather than national ones. That’s what “intellectual property” does.

&gt; . . .

&gt; So what’s falsely called “free trade” today isn’t a decrease in protectionism. It’s a shift from one kind of protectionism that no longer serves corporate interests, to a new kind of protectionism that better serves them.",Thanks,11756,83,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

We have regressed a significant amount over the last 50 years when it comes to tolerance and acceptance of opposing ideas. It's completely close minded, anti-intellectual behavior fostered by an almost religious like fervor. I think you've had a lot of people trade in traditional religions for new ones. Funny that, people being tribal. Go figure.

I think part of the problem is that as living conditions have improved over the last 50 years and many societal issues were largely resolved to a satisfactory degree, the politics of both right and left had to become more extreme to differentiate themselves. As they became more extreme, they had a harder time rationally defending their positions and it became more about appealing to emotion and fear of the other side, making the rift even larger.

And actually, I still stand by my point about moderation as opposed to centrism. The idea that it's better to be open minded and accepting is itself a pitfall. Yes, we believe that it's better to be moderate and open-minded, and that's what makes us moderates. What I'm saying is that there's a danger of our faith in moderation turning into pretentiousness, when we start acting like our open-mindedness makes us inherently better people.

Or put it this way. Liberals presumably hate it when conservatives act like they have a headstart in an argument because they're more logical and intelligent. Conservatives hate it when liberals act like they're more moral and thoughtful. I just feel like there's a big danger of the same happening to moderates; that both liberals and conservatives get put off by moderates, because we appear on our high horses and act like our open-mindedness is automatically a point in our favour.

And the reason I brought all this up in the first place, is because I feel like this article either reaches or is approaching that danger zone.

Behavior like what I had in the parentheses is what I think we should hold up as just the general standard for society. It should especially be the expected behavior for politicians.

Just look at discussions whenever there's a mass shooting.

"A: Indeed. I recently watched some old YouTube videos from the 60's of William F Buckley interviewing Allen Ginsberg, and man, you could not have a more cordial exchange between two people with polar opposite views of the world. We have regressed a significant amount over the last 50 years when it comes to tolerance and acceptance of opposing ideas. It's completely close minded, anti-intellectual behavior fostered by an almost religious like fervor. I think you've had a lot of people trade in traditional religions for new ones. Funny that, people being tribal. Go figure.

I think part of the problem is that as living conditions have improved over the last 50 years and many societal issues were largely resolved to a satisfactory degree, the politics of both right and left had to become more extreme to differentiate themselves. As they became more extreme, they had a harder time rationally defending their positions and it became more about appealing to emotion and fear of the other side, making the rift even larger.

I could be totally wrong of course, but I think that might have at least a little to do with where we are today.","When you pair that with the fact that there is no compromise in our government anymore, it only drives the point home that there is such a divide that neither side can agree on anything.

I think both sides do agree on the *problems* facing the country. They just don't agree on the *solutions*.  
Take health care as an example. Both sides agree that the ACA is not great. Where they differ is in their attempts to fix it. Republicans think government intervention distorts the market, so they think there should be less of it. Democrats think that government intervention is necessary when the market fails, and they think that the health insurance market is such a market.","The problem with that nuanced view is that one side is informed by science and data while the other isn't.  Anyone who is anti vaccine is on the side of not being informed by science. Anyone who is anti EPA is on the side of not being informed by facts.

"C: Ah yes, that would've been something important for me to get right off the bat. I'll use ""moderate"" the way you define it, and reserve ""centrism"" for the ideology.

Well, it's interesting that you specifically say, they could see the other side as ""evil"" or ""greedy"". Is that really at all compatible with moderation? If you see the other side that way, it doesn't seem possible that you'd then be moderate enough to change your mind when presented with new information. If you are, then I wouldn't say you ever truly thought of the other side as ""evil"" or ""greedy"".

And actually, I still stand by my point about moderation as opposed to centrism. The idea that it's better to be open minded and accepting is itself a pitfall. Yes, we believe that it's better to be moderate and open-minded, and that's what makes us moderates. What I'm saying is that there's a danger of our faith in moderation turning into pretentiousness, when we start acting like our open-mindedness makes us inherently better people.

Or put it this way. Liberals presumably hate it when conservatives act like they have a headstart in an argument because they're more logical and intelligent. Conservatives hate it when liberals act like they're more moral and thoughtful. I just feel like there's a big danger of the same happening to moderates; that both liberals and conservatives get put off by moderates, because we appear on our high horses and act like our open-mindedness is automatically a point in our favour.

And the reason I brought all this up in the first place, is because I feel like this article either reaches or is approaching that danger zone. It's easy for us to read ""humility is the fundamental virtue"" and be like, ""yep, totes agree, moderates ftw"", but that's because we're moderates. To someone who doesn't identify themselves as such, this comes across as incredibly pretentious self-flattery, and doesn't do anything to actually reach out to people.

Funnily enough, another point in the article is that moderates are harder on themselves than they are on their opponents, which I am definitely proving right at the moment :P",(pass),6395,17,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics
"A: &gt; If you are, then I wouldn't say you ever truly thought of the other side as ""evil"" or ""greedy"".

I agree, somewhat. A moderate doesn't ""truly believe"" in anything. There's always room in the moderate's mind for some doubt. 

&gt; What I'm saying is that there's a danger of our faith in moderation turning into pretentiousness, when we start acting like our open-mindedness makes us inherently better people.

I believe it *does* make us better people.  
Do you really think, that all other things being equal, an open minded person is not better than a close minded person? 

&gt; To someone who doesn't identify themselves as such, this comes across as incredibly pretentious self-flattery, and doesn't do anything to actually reach out to people.

I agree that the article feels more like the author is patting himself on the back rather than trying to encourage others to become Moderates too. ","&gt;With all that being said, what the hell is ""Humility is the fundamental virtue"" about?

It's the essence of civil and civic discourse. The sort of person that never thinks they're wrong will never reconsider their positions when warranted and is also the sort of person that demonizes everyone with whom they disagree.

This is epistemic humility, the willingness to reconsider our views, and I'd submit it's at the very heart of what it means to be moderate, as well as the heart of civil discourse.",6395,18,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics

I don't doubt that humility is at the heart of good discourse, nor do I think it isn't at least a major part of being a moderate. I'm just sceptical of how helpful it is to talk about it in such terms. I think it might be partly a subtle difference between ""it's always good to be humble"", and ""moderates are always humble"". The latter is essentially what is being said in the article. It's a list of points about ""what moderates believe"", with ""humility is the fundamental virtue"" being one of them; the implication here is that that's unique to moderates, and therefore an insult to readers who wouldn't describe themselves as such.

As an analogy that I think you might understand well, think about sexual harassment. Now, an overwhelming proportion of sexual harassment cases are perpetrated against women. But is it actually helpful to frame the war against sexual harassment as an explicitly feminist thing? If you're convinced by ""sexual harassment against women is bad"", you'd just as easily be convinced by ""sexual harassment is bad"", full stop. All the former really adds is the danger of alienating men who would otherwise gladly denounce sexual harassment, but are put off by the women-first rhetoric attached to it. It's the same with this; you're not changing any additional minds by attributing humility to moderation instead of just encouraging it, but you are running the risk of alienating people.",6395,19,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics
"A: If I'm reading your comment right, it sounds like you're suggesting we advocate for the behavior that might be considered moderate (such as a willingness to listen and try to understand opposing ideas, act in good faith, or compromise) without attaching it to yet another label that causes people to resort to further tribalism. If I got that right, then I fully agree.

Behavior like what I had in the parentheses is what I think we should hold up as just the general standard for society. It should especially be the expected behavior for politicians. I think one of the bigger issues today is the attachment people make between their identity and political labels. There's less concern about actual ideas on policy and more focus on protecting one's own label or tarnishing the opposition.

Just look at discussions whenever there's a mass shooting. There's usually heavy focus on trying to label the shooter as a conservative/liberal followed by inane semantic debates on what makes someone a liberal or conservative. As if these are two clearly distinct groups with bold dividing lines that have been unchanged since the dawn of humanity. ","Your point on falling into a superiority trap is well taken and I would agree that it should be avoided. However, I would disagree with your claim that having moderate political beliefs isn't superior to being either hard left or right. if you classify yourself as either left or right you are most likely subscribing to a certain set of disconnected political beliefs that are set in stone. Believe the government is too large and bloated? Well then you most likely also believe that abortion should be illegal. But why? These things have nothing to do with each other and could even be argued are counter to each other. A moderate on the other hand, has a higher likelihood of thinking through individual issues and picking and choosing their positions based on sound reason rather than a particular dogma. So in that regard, I would argue there is a bit of intellectual superiority, but I would agree with you that it's counter-productive to beat people over the head with that fact. One could easily fall into a trap of saying, ""Well I'm a moderate and I've thought about all sides of the issue, therefore my position on any one particular topic must be the correct one."" I would agree that one should refrain from making such an erroneous conclusion.

I think one can hold the belief that a moderate approach to politics is generally superior, without then going around and using that fact to bludgeon people with it. I don't think we have to deny the basic truth of the matter in order to get people to not be assholes about it.

Stanley O'Neal from Merrill Lynch and Co got $161,500,000 on his way out after that mess he pulled there. Something seems very wrong about that.

","Sure, I can link you to some of the books used in university-level courses on corruption, an aspect of the abuse of power. Nearly all studies of this subject in the political science academia show a correlation that higher salary is correlated with less corruption. 

But inferring that this means increasing salary would automatically kill corruption is entirely not understanding how political science and economics work. Abuse of power occurs in situations that have countless factors allowing them to thrive: lack of oversight, lack of accountability, disenfranchised citizens, lack of competition, societal standards, moral values, lack of coverage, government infrastructure, and government negligence just to name a few. For unique situations, maybe one factor could be the tipping point, but for most abuse of power cases it is a combination of such factors or lack thereof. Limiting the presences of these factors would lead to a decline of likelihood of abuse of power. High salary itself is not enough to rid government of corruption.

There is a difference between paying private company executives higher salary than paying public officials because public officials have more public scrutiny and accountability expectation than business leaders, at least in democratic states. Also, public officials and business leaders have different responsibilities and interests.

"B: I will look into those titles, thanks.","The underlying assumption of your question is that it's the job of elected officials to manage the state of the economy. I understand that, in today's political climate, this seems like a given, but it's not.

In the US, the Constitution is the prevailing document of law. Its stated purpose is ""to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity"". That says nothing about managing the economy, and traditionally, the US practiced something closer to [Laissez-faire capitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire#United_States) than we have now.

The shift occurred because political analysts realized that the people would often vote in their economic best interests, so it was easier to get elected if you could demonstrate policies that would broadly strenthen the economy. Ronald Reagan famously ran by asking voters, ""Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"" James Carville opined as Bill Clinton's campaign strategy, ""It's the economy, stupid!""

As for pros and cons, I think the pros are obvious. But if we incentivize economic performance, what happens when the economic benefit of a policy stands in conflict with officials' other duties? For instance, abolition of slavery was disastrous to the South, and the resulting Civil War nearly bankrupted the entire nation. Does that mean elected officials would have been right to support slavery? Generally speaking, war brings about strong economic performance. Does that mean we should incentivize elected officials to keep us in a state of constant war? There are so many policies that are right, just, and of widespread benefit to the populace that don't result in direct improvement to the economy (especially within the average elected official's term). It would be counter to the goals of governance to place the state of the economy above all those other policies by implementing incentives.",11859,41,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: Perhaps you're right. I took ""indexed to the current state of the economy"" to mean that salaries would continuously fluctuate depending on how well the economy was doing, but maybe that's not what OP meant.","We can only hope he see's our posts and clarifies for us.

"A: I don't think that career politicians deserve the disdain that most people have for them.


First, recognize that it takes money to win elections.  Rich people have the advantage because in addition to their personal wealth, they tend to have personal connections with other people who have a lot of money.  The only way for the common man to develop the same kind of personal connections is through years of service in public office.


Congressmen get paid well and receive lots of perks, so it's not surprising that all of them seem rich, but in reality, the vast majority of politicians hold local district seats that do not pay very well for the work involved.  


Also, I find it hard to fault these career politicians for taking lobbying jobs once they are out of office.  Most of them still have families to support and what other employment opportunities are available after spending 10+ years in public office?


**TL;DR: Becoming a career politician and working their way up is the only way for a poor person to hold a higher office**","Absolutely not.

"C: There are lots of calls [from Democrats for independent investigations](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/senate-democrats-meeting-trump-russia-235036) regarding Flynn, Trump, and Russia.

Some background on where various Republicans stand on investigating

**In the House:**

[Chaffetz - chair of Oversight - says Oversight won't investigate Flynn](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/319410-gop-chairman-oversight-wont-investigate-flynn), either thinks no investigation is necessary or is passing the buck to Intelligence:
&gt;""I think that situation has taken care of itself. I know that the Intel committee is looking into the hacking issue,"" Chaffetz told reporters. 

but also:

&gt;""It really is the purview of the Intel Committee. They really are the only ones that can look at that type of information, particularly when you’re talking about interactions with a nation-state like that. It’s not something the Oversight Committee can actually look at because sources and methods are the exclusive purview of the Intel Committee,""

[Nunez - chair of Intelligence - says they won't investigate Flynn](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/319421-chairman-house-intel-panel-wont-investigate-flynn-will-probe-leaks).

Walker, member of the Intelligence committee, says [“I have not seen the evidence that there is any kind of collaboration that would require an investigation at this point.”](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/14/house-republicans-democrats-flynn-investigation/97889998/)

**In the Senate:**

[Democrat Mark Warner says the Senate Intelligence Committee is investigating Russia and the 2016 election, which apparently has expanded](http://www.newsweek.com/senate-investigation-russia-557268):

&gt;“And then third, the question—the scope has even expanded—of any contacts between members of either campaign and Russian officials before the election,” Warner said. “And obviously part of this in terms of what’s happened with General Flynn, now, extends into contacts that took place after the election.”

In addition, [McCain and other Republicans senators seem interested in an investigation](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/14/politics/republicans-want-flynn-investigations/).

While this is true, the committee is majority republicans(8 to 7), so a vote that came down along party lines would favor the republicans.

Edit: 10 to 9, not 8 to 7, including the ex officio members. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence","None of the responses addressed your core question so let me take a stab at it:

First, the investigation/s of Russia and their possible state-sponsored interference of the US election. It's worth noting for the past 50ish years most countries keep a respectful distance from one another during their democratic processes. They tend to shy away from picking one candidate over another and make generic statements such as ""looking forward to our continued partnership"".  In the case of Russia  there is a growing concern that Russia is actively engaged in attempting to tilt/shift elections in multiple countries in ways that are advantageous to their interests, either by electing people who are pro Russia or people who will execute policies that are beneficial to Russia. In the case of the US there appears to be evidence and consensus among the US intelligence community that the Russians obtained information about politicians in the US and selectively released it to their advantage. On one end of the scale you have the Russians who say they were not involved, that the US only has its self to blame for its problems. On the other you have a chorus of people claiming the Russians ""stole"" the election and thwarted the entire democratic process. In the middle you have people who claim the Russians had a goal of weakening/discrediting a future president Clinton and just got really lucky with their efforts.

Second, Trump. That's a loaded one so I'm going to tried carefully. Trumps investigations, if any, break down into 3 main groups:

1. Possible collusion between his campaign and the Russians during the election. There is ample speculative evidence due to many of his key staffers having direct or indirect ties to Russia but beyond that nothing public has come for light that has triggered a criminal investigation (that we know of). Plenty of investigations and conducted in secret and/or concluded with nothing substantive found. 

2. Trumps personal business dealings. Trump and his many companies have relationships around the globe. There are concerns about them beyond Russia, but given the alleged Russian involvement I mentioned earlier many have made accusations that trump, his family, or his business ventures could directly benefit from his presidency. The accusers cite Trumps unwillingness to release his tax returns and other information as proof of some form of guilt, whereas his supporters note he has complied to disclose where required by law.

3. Blackmail. There have been wild and salacious accusations directed at Trump and others in his staff, that the Russians have obtained deeply embarrassing or illegal material and are being blackmailed.

While some of the things I mentioned aren't explicitly illegal there's been a pervasive sense of ""truth in lending"" with our public officials. This is the first time in modern history that a President has asserted his right to still be a private citizen, which people who oppose him immediately tend to assume implies deceit.

Third, Michael Flynn. I won't touch on the financial accusations with Russia only to say there are some floating around. The big one is his potential violation of the Logan Act. Basically, it's illegal to conduct the business of the United States with foreign governments if you aren't elected to an official capacity in the government that requires you to perform those functions. In the case of Mr Flynn he may have gotten ahead of himself in his conversations with his Russian counterparts before he actually started working in his official capacity at the National Security Counsel. It's important to note that no one has ever been prosecuted for the Logan Act. That being said Mr Flynn did resign from his position, so he either did so to avoid distracting the new administration with a ""scandal"" or he wanted to avoid a formal investigation. Either way, it seems to have settled down for now.

The bottom line is you have a new administration who was not elected via popular vote. The opposition to the Trump administration is going to magnify any grain of information that comes out, and the press will run with it because it brings good ratings. Whether these things will actually bring some form of an investigation remains to be seen.

"C: Speaking exclusively about [Section 2 of the Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/04/presidential-executive-order-promoting-free-speech-and-religious-liberty)...

[26 U.S. Code § 501 - Exemption from tax on corporations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501) defines the qualifying criteria on fully tax-exempt religious organizations as such:

&gt; [Any religious] foundation, organized and operated exclusively for religious... purposes..., no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation..., and which does not participate in, or intervene in..., any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.  

The stated purpose of the Executive Order Sec. 2. is, ""Respecting Religious and Political Speech"" -- i.e. so as to allow this sort of political activism under the protection of constitutional free speech without any threat or action of revocation of tax-exempt status as a 501(c)-3 organization.  

---
There is some important context to consider:  

First, being a 501(c)-3 organization means that not only is the organization's income tax-exempt, but **also the donations of individuals to the foundation are tax-deductible to those individuals.**  

Second, there are other provisions under this section of the tax code that still provide tax-exempt status on the organization's income (e.g. 501(c)-4). The ~~only~~ relevant difference is that the **individual donations would no longer be tax-deductible for those individuals.** The tax-exempt status of the organization's income would remain intact under other, similar classifications that are not impacted by the Johnson Amendment.

Third, in approximately the last 20 years, not one 501(c)-3 organization has had its status as such revoked as a result of violating the Johnson Amendment.

That third point ostensibly demonstrates that, in effect, the Johnson Amendment already doesn't exist as it is not being enforced. Therefore the Executive Order effectively accomplishes very little of substance with regard to ""Respecting Religious and Political Speech"".

You can definitely say, ""Don't vote for someone who favors abortion, favor only Christian candidates."" You a line like, ""Donald Trump is an immoral candidate,"" is questionable because you can't specifically campaign against a candidate, though the limits of that have never been explored.  You under current rules, you're not supposed to say, ""Hilary Clinton is a murderer, Donald Trump is an adulterer, vote Jill Stein, baby, for a verdant Christian world!"" That is, endorse a specific candidate and tell your flock how to vote. 

However, some churches go out of their way to record themselves saying just this, and mail these tapes to the IRS saying, essentially, ""Try me."" Since 2008, this has been organized as ""Pulpit Freedom Sunday"". To my knowledge, the IRS says this is something that can make a religious organization lose its non-profit status, but they have maybe only done it once (when a church place an ad in the USA Today saying it would be sinful to vote for Clinton comma Bill) and officially stopped all investigations since 2009 (Thanks, Obama?):

&gt;It was after the IRS lost a 2009 lawsuit over its procedural process in investigating the Living Word Christian Center following the church's endorsement of former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., that the agency halted investigations, according to Politico.

&gt;The IRS sued the church for refusing to hand over its records, but a judge threw out the case over the fact that a regional commissioner should have been approving church audits. The job, however, had been axed from the agency ranks, meaning that the government was using lower-level IRS staffers, which the judge said was inappropriate.

That's from a real good [*Deseret News* (close to the Mormon Church) article about the issue](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865658366/The-long-2-and-surprising-2-history-behind-the-IRS-ban-on-churches-endorsing-political-candidates.html), which gives a great history. Repealing the Johnson Amendment was in the Republican Platform in 2016. (Ironically, it seems the Johnson amendment was [adopted in 1954 to prevent two *secular* non-profit organizations from campaigning against Johnson](http://blogs.christianpost.com/liberty/the-johnson-amendment-is-a-fat-opossum-2881/).)

Whether this EO weakens or strengthens the Johnson Amendment frustratingly depends on legal interpretation, but it [may further weaken the already neutered Johnson Amendment](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/trump-ease-tax-rules-religious-groups-may-endorse-political-candidates/) and, at the very least, should be seen as a signal to Evangelicals and other conservative religious groups that they can safely ignore the Johnson Amendment. 

&gt;Ralph Reed, a longtime evangelical leader and founder of the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition, said he was briefed by White House officials about the text of the executive order. [...]

&gt;“This administratively removes the threat of harassment.”
Reed said he was “thrilled” by the language on the IRS restrictions on partisan political activity. “This administratively removes the threat of harassment,” Reed said in a phone interview. “That is a really big deal.” He said the language in the order related to the preventive care mandate will “ensure that as long as Donald Trump is president, that something like the Little Sisters of the Poor case will never happen again.”

The Little Sisters of the Poor is a separate issue(Section 3), and I was mainly talking about Sections 2 and 4. So I disagree with all those that say it doesn't actually do anything. It, at the very least, is a strong signal. That's certainly how people like Reed are taking it, after all. ",(pass),6759,17,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: That's a document from 1993 (notice the title and that it cites things from 1989, 1991, and 1992, but nothing after) which I believe is thoroughly outdated. Do you have anything more current? From everything I've read, nothing in the last twenty years resembles that at all. Again, literally one church is known to have lost its tax-exempt status due to political activities.  From what I know, I believe these sorts of issue-based discussions are relatively common, and the recent interpretation of the rule has generally been that it's outright political endorsements which are treyf, ""issue-based"" advocacy is kosher. From that PBS article cited above:

&gt;The regulation, named for then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson, was put into force in 1954 and prohibited partisan political activity for churches and other tax-exempt organizations. The policy still allows a wide range of advocacy on political issues, but in the case of houses of worship, it bars electioneering and outright political endorsements from the pulpit. The rule has rarely been enforced.

&gt;The IRS does not make public its investigations in such cases, but only one church is known to have lost its tax-exempt status as a result of the prohibition. The Church at Pierce Creek in Conklin, New York, was penalized for taking out newspaper ads telling Christians they could not vote for Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election. Even so, some religious leaders have argued the rule has a chilling effect on free speech, and have advocated for years for repeal.","&gt; which I believe is thoroughly outdated

&gt; President Trump’s prior assertion that he wished to ‘totally destroy’ the Johnson Amendment with this order has proven to be a textbook case of ‘fake news.’

Pepperidge Farm remembers when fake news was a term referring specifically to articles that had the appearance of legitimate news, but were actually fiction (or distortions of the truth intended to reshape reality). Trump (et al) has degraded this term to refer to any presentation of facts that are distasteful.  

Here, the ACLU has used the term here to refer to a (campaign) lie, or a statement of intent that he has failed to make real, further degrades the term.

I object to this because, without the term ""fake news"" to refer to *actual fake news* [sic], fake news gets even more dangerous. The water is muddy, and that term helped clarify it.

Isn't that exactly what Trump does? When he is saying this order ""totally destroys"" the Johnson Amendment, when it really doesn't, and his statements are meant to make it seem like he's taking hard action against 'attacks on religion', would that not be a) distortion of the truth and b) reshaping what reality shows?

Think of it this way: if you saw a Breitbart article exclaiming that Trump's executive order totally destroyed the Johnson Amendment and has struck a strong blow for religious liberty, would you not call that fake news? It's fiction. It's false. It really does not do that. It's more than a distasteful presentation, it distorts the truth in a way that misleads its audience.

The abolishment of the electoral college in popoular elections, which grant [certain citizens of different districts of different states far more voting power than others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banzhaf_power_index). This is done by partitioning voters (by region or otherwise) and arbitrarily assigning a partition a certain number of votes to cast after determining how many votes are required to win a vote. The Banzhaf index is a good model until you have huge disparity in the power of individual groups to vote. You will never hear the voices of certain groups in an election. For example, a vote from Vermont is worth about half of a Californian vote, per person in a national election.

It would seem that these countries not only have a similar standard of living to the United States, but receive more government services. Furthermore, they have less deferred debt and have better job security. 

However, these countries also spend tiny fractions of their already small GDPs on defense. Norway spends 7.2b (1.4%), Finland spends 2.7b (1.3%), Switzerland spends 4.83b (.7%), Denmark spends 3.7b (~1.3%) and Sweden spends 5.7b (~1.1%). These numbers are all adjusted to USD. [6](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS)

The United States has good diplomatic relations with all of these countries. Denmark is engaged in Afghanistan along with US troops [7](http://www.fmn.dk/eng/allabout/Pages/ThedanishengagementinAfghanistan.aspx) [8](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3167.htm). Sweden and the US are strong economic partners [9](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2880.htm). Norway is a NATO member [10](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/nato_countries.htm).

Switzerland and the US actively work together to counter money-laundering, terrorism, and other activities [12](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3431.htm).

The point that I'm trying to make is that all of these countries are supported by the US in such a way that would suggest that if they were to be attacked the US would support them militarily. This would explain the relatively low spending on defense by these countries. 

If these countries were forced to supply their own defense, would they be able to support their social programs? What does this say about the possibility of the US adapting similar social programs?","The US military budget is one gigantic humongous lie.

Oh and the US stayed there and is still there - ready to help South Korea if the North should ever try to start a war again

"A: I don't think it says much, honestly. When you look at tax rates, all of the Nordic countries have a VAT (which is a consumption/sales tax) of around 25%, whereas the US national average is 5.45%.

Current revenue generated by sales tax in the United States is [$490 billion](http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/year_revenue_2016USrn_17rs1n_40#usgs302). That would turn into $2.248 trillion if tax levels were increased to the rates they are in the Nordic countries.

What additional funds would be available if military spending was cut to NATO recommended levels, or Sweden's? NATO recommends 2% of GDP, which would be roughly $340 billion, $276 million less than current levels. 0.7% would be around $119 billion, a potential savings of $497 billion. Both of those totals are still relatively modest compared to the revenue totals yielded from a VAT equivalent. That's the real difference, not defense spending. (Obviously very imprecise calculations, but the difference is still pretty significant).

From the Nordic perspective, the Finlands and Swedens of the world are never going to have the responsibilities of a regional or great power - they don't have the economy or population for it. If the US, for some reason, abdicated from its European responsibilities, I doubt we'd see defense spending increase a great deal, but rather more emphasis on the European Union's potential role as a collective security organization (facilitating a joint nuclear deterrent, conventional military support from larger countries).

The reason why the military budget is so low is because 5 billion CHF per year is already plenty sufficient for the level of threat Switzerland currently faces, but mostly because the Swiss military is extremely wasteful with the money in the first place (I know somebody in the mountain corps that was ordered to ski on gravel, just so that the army could claim it needed new skis, and therefore keep it's budget).

Nordic states, are very productive and exceptional places to live, but (and yes I am generalizing here) bureaucracies can remain small and lean by comparison.

This is not to say that it is bad, but rather only point out what is in my view the main obstacle. 

For the Nordic countries, I doubt a large enough tax base exists for them to acquire and maintain the strategic systems necessary to deter a country like...Russia. They all rely upon mutual self defense and some rely upon NATO. I think if the Nordic countries did up defense spending to 2%, the marginal benefit wouldn't be that great. Maybe each country might stand up a new Brigade or Regiment or increase readiness rates or something, but in strategic terms, this isn't disruptive. Sure, it would result in either a tax increase or a cut to some services, but I doubt a raise to 2% of GDP would cause a societal shift away from the welfare state. 

The criticism the US levels at European powers regarding defense spending is directed to larger ones with a Defense Industrial Base. Think Germany, The UK, to a lesser extent, France.

&gt;The SALT deduction was assumed even before the constitutional income tax of 1913 as is mentioned else-ware in this thread an unconstitutional income tax was tried before Amend 16.

Again, that an idea is old does not make it good.

&gt;Do you have any evidence that high tax states take in more money than they pay to the federal government?

No, and that's not even close to the point.  If you make X dollars, you should pay the same federal income tax, regardless of what state you live in.  There is zero moral or economic basis for changing how much federal tax you pay based on where you live.

Ya that is right if you assume that the States are all equivalent subsets of a central government and there is no difference between how states need to tax/spend.

Any bracket is limited in assuming that people within a bracket should be taxed evenly... but to me, if you're making $38K and you get a raise to $43K, that $5K raise should be taxed at a lower rate than someone making $86K who got a raise to $91K.

I will happily defend that moral assertion.  But you'll note, that in this long thread, not a single person has offered a MORAL defense of why someone making 100k in alabama should pay more federal tax than someone making 100k in new york.  When pressed, they all fall back on some other argument

&gt;Fundamentally, our tax dollars are to be used, as the Constitution puts it, to provide and promote the common welfare.

that's not what the constitution says.  

&gt;Similarly, federal grants are given to those states that have trouble providing for their own citizens. This comes in many forms from welfare programs given to directly to individuals (like medicaid, financial assistance, food stamps, and energy assistance), to larger programs targeted at whole communities (like education grants to local schools, grants to cities to build infrastructure, and farm subsidies). Some states, however, are better able to provide for their own citizens and do not need to receive as much money from the federal government to assist with these programs. Generally these states can better provide for their citizens because they pay more in state taxes.

Let's assume this is the case.  In that case, you should be in favor of abolishing salt.   Your argument here is, essentially, that some states are too poor to pay for a decent lives for themselves, and need help.  Alright, that's a consistent, sound argument.  what isn't sound is to ""some states are too poor, and they need help, so they should be taxed more and their own money given back to them as aid.""  If you truly believe that the richer states should help the poorer, then the LAST thing you should want is SALT, since it generally transfers money away from poorer states.  ","&gt; But you'll note, that in this long thread, not a single person has offered a MORAL defense of why someone making 100k in alabama should pay more federal tax than someone making 100k in new york.

I believe I did make that argument. The moral argument is that I am paying the state to provide certain services that the federal government offers. If I am paying the state to give me those services, why should I also need to pay the government for those services?

&gt;&gt; Fundamentally, our tax dollars are to be used, as the Constitution puts it, to provide and promote the common welfare.

Alright, that's a consistent, sound argument. what isn't sound is to ""some states are too poor, and they need help, so they should be taxed more and their own money given back to them as aid."" If you truly believe that the richer states should help the poorer, then the LAST thing you should want is SALT, since it generally transfers money away from poorer states.

That would be a valid argument if states were destined for some reason to always be poor and unable to pay for their own programs. But a major reason why they are too poor to pay for their programs is that their state and local taxes are too low, and thus they require more aid from the federal government. If they had higher taxes and spent that money on these programs, they wouldn't need to spend receive so much money from the federal government and everyone's federal taxes could be lower. Why should the people of my state subsidize another state for their own fiscal irresponsibility?


You see, I am of the opinion that a person knows best how to spend their own money, followed by their municipality, then their state, and finally the federal government. I am absolutely fine with higher state and local taxes if it means fewer federal taxes, because my state and locale can better address my needs in a much more efficient manner than the federal government can. What I don't like is the federal government robbing Peter to pay Paul. Removing the SALT deduction is taking the money away from me so it can go to the federal government which will then give it to a state that doesn't want be fiscally responsible and pay for its own programs.",7340,109,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

&gt;
&gt;Common welfare and general welfare are not the same thing.  General welfare is a specific, and legally loaded, phrase.  

Not, it really isn't. In fact, one of the reasons that clause is so controversial is that general welfare is not defined anywhere and can be as broad or narrow as the interpereter wants it to be. Madison, for instance, favored the narrow inteperetation, while Hamilton argued that it meant Congress coupd lay wahetever taxes they wanted so long as it would provide benefit to the nation.

No, you didn't. You just said they were wrong without giving any reason. Looks at the data: states that have higher taxes receive tend to receive less block grants and aid from the federal government. That is a fact. My argument is that this is, in part, because their higher state and local taxes are paying for programs that would otherwise be funded in part by block grants from the federal government.

&gt;
&gt;They shouldn't.  And if you think they are, the proper response is to abolish the programs you think they are abusing, not force them to pay taxes for programs that they don't want. 

I am also in favor of that, but given as that is not going to happen, it is a stupid idea to raise  people's taxes to pay for the fiscal irresponsibility of other states.

&gt; Your argument amounts to saying that you should tax people on welfare for the cost of the their welfare, in order to teach them not to use welfare. it's incoherent.

"B: It may not be a MORAL defense, but perhaps its helps to distinguish whether the purpose of tax deductions is to be ""fair"" or to add some economic incentive to a desired behavior.
If we think of deduction as an economic incentive to do the ""right"" thing then SALT deductions might make more sense. Items such as student loan interest, charitable donations,  and medical costs are deductible because we want people to educate themselves, help out the less fortunate, and help prevent medically induced poverty. We increase tax on cigarettes, alcohol, and other behaviors we want to discourage. The criticism of the estate tax is that it double taxes income, but we justify this because we are trying to discourage the accumulation of excessive generational wealth. Alternatively, SALT deductions remove the double taxing of income because we want to encourage states to be pro-active in improving schools and roads, and increasing their emergency slush funds. This gets into where tax law moves away from what is ""fair"" into the economics of influencing behavior. The same way we structure the tax code to encourage people to be better citizens, so should we structure it to promote states bettering themselves.

But that's *not* the argument WalletHub makes when they look at [federal dependency](https://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700/), which shows hardly any correlation between effective tax rates and their metric for federal dependency. If states were actually using federal aid to artificially cut their own taxes, you'd expect a much stronger negative correlation.

Whether a state is a net recipient or contributor of federal funds is explained much more by that state's GDP than by the state [tax rates](https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-states-to-be-a-taxpayer/2416/) for a median taxpayer. The correlation between those effective tax rates and federal dependency, using WalletHub's numbers, is only about -0.13. That's pretty much nothing.

When I looked at that my first thought was, well, maybe median rates are a poor indicator since higher earners are much more likely to itemize and take SALT deductions. Turns out that's not a great argument either.

Even if you look at the correlation between federal dependency and the maximum of [state and local sales tax](https://taxfoundation.org/state-and-local-sales-tax-rates-in-2017/) or the [highest state income tax brackets](https://taxfoundation.org/state-individual-income-tax-rates-brackets-2017/), the correlation between a state's tax rate and its dependency on federal funding just isn't there.

The only rate that makes sense for this comparison is property taxes, which do in fact have a moderate correlation with WalletHub's measure of federal dependency. State property taxes are still deductible in the house's tax bill, though.

Relying on federally subsidized states to raise their own taxes to fund welfare programs in the federal governments stead is sort of wishful thinking regardless, but it doesn't seem backed up by the data either.

So instead of getting up in arms about SALT, get angry about where the GOP plan is *cutting* taxes.

The argument that's been coming up in this thread is that, as I understand it, SALT is an incentive for more local governance which blue states are taking advantage of more often than red states, and that this explains the differences in federal funding. So instead of removing SALT, red states should just raise their taxes and replace federal programs with (presumably more efficient) local ones.

If you look at the analysis on the pages being linked, though, federal dependency depends on how rich or poor a state is much more than that state's tax rates. Tax rates or tax burdens correlate quite weakly with federal dependency* while tax income, average SALT deduction, or other things measured in dollars show a stronger correlation since they include an effect from that state's GDP and not just the state's tax policy.

So if federally dependent states can't wean themselves off that funding by raising taxes, then this particular argument for defending SALT doesn't seem coherent.

\* Take the numbers from WalletHub and throw them in Excel or otherwise look at the correlations yourself. Total tax burden vs federal dependency is *r* = -0.15, or *r* = -0.20 if you go by rank. That seems too low to draw serious conclusions from to me.

"A: &gt;I bet if you normalize both axis 0-1 and plot a line y=x, you will find that Red states cluster on the low tax-federally dependent side of the curve.

You're not wrong. [Scaled](https://imgur.com/a/V2r81), with quadrants and y=x sloppily added in paint.

However, while red states are more likely overall to have lower tax burdens their federal dependencies are still all over the map. West Virginia and Mississippi already have above average tax burdens but they're some of the most dependent states, for example. Meanwhile Florida, Alaska, and Oklahoma are in the low dependence quadrant but have some of the lowest tax burdens on the graph (and Alaska is unusual, sure, but Oklahoma?)

Ultimately, though, I don't think our interpretations of the data are incompatible. It's possible for red states to be more dependent *and* for dependency to be mostly independent from tax policy. Blue states are less dependent but have a wide range of tax burdens. Red states have lower taxes and a wide range of dependency. The result is that red states are more likely to be dependent than blue ones, but not that high dependency red states could change this by raising taxes (since plenty of low dependency red states have similar or lower tax rates.)

Eliminating SALT is almost certainly a partisan move that will redistribute wealth from blue states to red ones. That doesn't automatically make the federal dependency argument for SALT deductions correct, however, *even if* blue states are less dependent on average.

(If you compared what each state *spends* its tax revenue on it might be the case that red states aren't spending effectively, which you could model by artificially lowering their tax burdens depending on some efficiency gap. I'm not keen on looking into that, since it's much thornier, but it might give you the correlation you want. Then you're in the tenuous position of hoping red states will raise taxes to fund programs that red states are traditionally against, though. That's less an argument in favor of SALT deductions and more of an argument for stronger federal regulation to bring backwards states up to par.)","You turned that graph around quick!

So I guess you are thinking from a pure calculus of the number stand point, I'm coming at it from more of a social angle. Let say you live and pay taxes in a Blue state, with high taxes and the following conditions happen:

1.) Red states tend to get back more than they give from the federal government

2.) The federal government, controlled by Republicans, will be effectively raising taxes for people in high tax states which tend to be blue by getting rid of one of the oldest parts of the income tax code.

&gt; Why California can the total collected in federal tax be 100 billion, and the total recieved in federal aid be 85 billion, but in Alabama the total collected can be 30 billion and total recieved in aid be 45 billion?

My point is California is a rich state, yet homeowners protecting their home value have made California unlivable for the working and middle class due to land use restrictions and a refusal to build up. The COL is a completely self imoposed problem, and it needs to be solved through  state policy that has nothing to do with balance of Federal Payments. I'm in California currently. I'm renting and earning in the 15% bracket and Im personally looking forward to my expanded standard deduction, lower bracket, and child tax credit expansion. Maybe with the legs chopped out from the MID prices will stabilized and I'll be able to purchase a home here someday.

"A: &gt; but what in the fuck does that have to do with this tax bill specifically targeting blue states and creating a larger imbalance at the federal level

The imbalance does not exist because Federal tax policy targets blue states. The imbalance exists because  federal tax policy is progressive and taxes the wealthy in order to pay benefits to the poor. Coincidentally, the wealthy are concentrated in blue states, and the poor in red states. It also tends to build military bases in areas where land is cheap so you can have a lot of it. Surprise surprise, land is much cheaper in Georgia then California (although California does have several incredibly large bases). 

&gt; I don't see what the discussion of the tax bill, are you arguing it will have a positive effect on the cost of living? Because there no basis for that.

What I mentioned was the effects on weakening the Mortgage Interest Deduction (MID). Housing cost is the biggest factor in overall cost of living, especially in California. Yet the MID [has no effect on home ownership, it just pushes people to get larger and more expensive houses](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137712000514). By weakening this incentive, the federal government gets out of the game of distorting housing values and driving up the COL. 

&gt; I don't think people like you realize that the cause of high prices in California is crazy demand with tons of people moving here and the occurance of high salaries. You can fomain about policy all day long but that is 95% of the reason prices are high. Also show me somewhere where home owners don't protect their home prices.

Cost of living is a supply and demand problem. If salaries rise, so does demand. But if the state doesn't let the housing supply rise to meet demand, or energy production rise to meet demand, or any number of other goods now being competed by between more dollars then prices will rise. As to people moving here, [California has a big outmigration problem](http://www.ocregister.com/2017/04/23/leaving-california-after-slowing-the-trend-intensifies/) with 12,000 people net leaving the bay area last year. 

As to showing somewhere homeowners don't protect prices [here's a chart to what states have the most and least land use restrictions] (https://www.freedominthe50states.org/custom/land-use/frent/frtp/fwrluri/mindex). CATO is definitely right leaning, but its data is from the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index which from a cursory google search appears to be solid. So to answer your question as to where homeowners don't protect their home prices the answer is probably nowhere, but the NIBYism of Red States doesn't hold a candle to that of California and the North East. 

&gt; You must make nothing if the new standard deduction and child tax credit cancels out the SALT deduction for you to even out and get a couple hundred bucks back, cause for the vast majority of us here it raises our taxes.

Does it? Granted my households cash compensation is only 64k, but that's barely below [median household income statewide], although I guess I'm about 10k shy of median family income for a family of 4. I'm better off than many Californians though because I have a good benefit package and healthcare, so I would venture to say I am probably around average if not above it. Using [this calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator#JtpTIVU9W7) my estimated state sales, income, and fuel taxes for 2017 are a bit over 4,000. Nowhere near where I would need to be to consider itemizing, its the MID that would probably make it worth my while. We can argue all day about what's middle class in California, but the term is so overused its almost meaningless at this point. For those in California and in the middle who can't afford to buy a home, this bill really doesn't impact them, and depending on the size of the child tax credit could actually help, maybe even to cover the new gas tax we're all coughing up now.","I stopped reading here:

The imbalance I am referring to is the new tax bill which absolutely does target blue states, if you can't see they you are honestly trying not to and being blind to it.

&gt;2.2.1 Congress should not interfere with state revenue systems. The independent ability of states to develop their own revenue systems is a basic tenet of self government and our federalist system. The federal government should not enact any legislation or adopt any regulation that would preempt, either directly or indirectly, sources of state revenues, state tax bases, or state taxation methods.

Edit: made second to last sentence clear",7340,151,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: &gt; But if doing away with the SALT deductions interferes with state revenue systems does this mean that all Federal Taxes interfere with state revenue systems?

Maybe, but I'm not making that argument. I'm saying eliminating the SALT deduction will drive behaviors that will interfere with some State's ability to collect revenue. It can be a simple as: now that people can't deduct SALT, the state has no choice but to cut taxes or lose tax base. Perhaps there are good reasons for the State to tax and spend as they do. If you are thinking ""hell ya the federal government should push the States to lower their taxes"". I simply disagree and find this counter to the tenants of federalism and State sovereignty.

Those 6 states account for over 40% of the nations GDP.

I'm going to disagree with your DWL angle: Eliminating the salt deduction will effectively drive the behavior of people trying to avoid paying property tax and state income tax (easiest way is by downsizing or moving to another state) and sending a greater share of their money to the Federal government, who, in my opinion, use the money less wisely than local government in many ways.

The tax bill increases the deficit yet will probably raises my taxes and is extremely partisan. I find the only reason someone would support this bill is if their wealthy donors want them to.

But what I was arguing earlier is that peoples final tax bill is going to be similar whether the deduction stays or not. If they let the wealthy deduct their state and local taxes, then they're going to raise the income tax rate, or the capital gains rate, or lower other deductions. People's bottom line will remain the same overall, because we tax to pay for the programs that get enacted, not simply for the sake of taxing.

The GGM Model developed by Seth G. Benzell, Laurence J. Kotlikoff
, and Guillermo Lagarda along with a few other economists shows that, or at least claims 3-5% higher economic growth and $3,500 in average wage growth. I think most of the authors work for Boston University but I could be wrong. Maybe its incorrect, but lots if not all economic models tend to be.

","I'm going to try to specifically address the reason as to why Egyptians are protesting as opposed to why they should be upset about things. There are plenty of countries with crippling un/underemployment, oppressive regimes, etc., and you don't see mass protests like those in Egypt. So I'm going to specifically attempt to address the mobilization factor in the Egyptian context.

**Economic woes**

This [NYT summary](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/21/opinion/egypts-economic-crisis.html?_r=0) should provide you with decent context. This line in particular is, in my mind, the crux of the matter: ""Egyptians want jobs, education and a say in governance."" These are all interconnected. The economic issues have backing in previous economic structures and the educational system.

Prior to the 2011 Revolution, Egypt was heavily dependent on two sources of income: tourism and foreign direct investment. Pre-revolution tourism accounted for around 11% of Egypt's GDP according to the OECD (cited in this [BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21293299)) Donors (and tourists) began to withdraw their investment from the country in droves in light of continued ongoing instability. This has contributed to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound and recent oil shortages.

Second, wealth in Egypt is highly concentrated in wealthy families and the military. This is not an argument will hear mentioned in Egyptian discourse, but a large issue with implementing any meaningful structural reform is challenging the stakeholders that benefit from the status quo. Zeinab abul-Magd wrote recently of this  in [Foreign Policy](http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/05/08/the_egyptian_republic_of_retired_generals). The largest issue is, as she states: 

&gt;Moreover, retired generals manage the vast enterprises owned by the military institution and produce goods and services for consumers rather than for military production. This includes chains of factories, service companies, farms, roads, gas stations, supermarkets, and much more. There are three major military bodies engaged in civilian production: the Ministry of Military Production, running eight factories; the Arab Organization for Industrialization, running 12 factories; and the National Service Products Organization, running 15 factories, companies, and farms. They produce a wide variety of goods, including luxury jeeps, infant incubators, butane gas cylinders, plastic tubes, canned food, meat, chicken, and more. They also provide services, like domestic cleaning and gas station management. 

In sum, the Egyptian economy is poorly structured and dependent on the state for economic dynamism, and the vested interests at the top have no interest in changing the status quo. This is combined with the fact that for years, Egyptian standards of living were increasing and are now being eroded by the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. Expectations are increasingly misaligned with reality, forcing average Egyptians to attempt to find redress through the state that largely created said expectations.

**Education**
One of Gamal Abdel Nasser's greatest contributions to Egyptian society was easing access to primary and secondary education. Colleges were made free to all pending successful passage of the Egyptian exam system. While in principle this is excellent, this sort of plays into the economic issues discussed above. Average Egyptians for years were essentially guaranteed jobs in government prior to the infitah (opening) reforms of Sadat and Mubarak. Economic restructuring forced the Egyptian government to cut public sector jobs and privatize government services that previously supplied jobs to Egyptian business majors and attorneys, as well as (and perhaps most notably) college-educated women. It can easily be argued that these reforms needed to be made, but the underlying reason for the job programs' existence was not addressed by the regime. As a result, there are vast sums of well-educated younger Egyptians (your prime ""revolutionary class,"" so to speak) that are currently unemployed, or more often underemployed and working in tourism or unrelated sectors. When the tourism sector was devastated following the revolution, these jobs became even less readily available than before. Just as an anecdote to demonstrate the extent of underemployment in Egypt, when I lived there in 2010, the person who installed the internet in my apartment in Cairo was an attorney by training.

**Polarization**
I would argue the catalyst for the recent protests has been the extent to which elements of Egyptian society have become detached from one another. Nathan Brown highlights this in his [recent piece](http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/06/27/will_june_30_be_midnight_for_morsis_cinderella_story) for Foreign Policy written immediately prior to the June 30 protests:

&gt;Egyptian politics now seems to operate in two parallel universes. On the one side is a simple story of a president and ruling political party that suffered years of oppression but were finally rewarded by the Egyptian people for their endurance, dedication, and honesty. Endowed with clear democratic and constitutional legitimacy -- and brought to power on the heels of a popular uprising that his movement helped lead -- President Morsi suddenly faces an array of forces who wish to rewrite the rules of the political game in a blatant attempt to overthrow the express will of the people. Stopping at nothing (the opposition uses false charges, accepts foreign assistance, uses shrill and incendiary rhetoric, refuses dialogue, and does not even stop at violating common decency by demonstrating in underwear), a collection of rude youth, power-hungry secular politicians, old regime elements, and scheming security services have conspired to declare, in effect, that Egyptians must be called to the ballot box only on condition that they reject Islamists (and if they make a mistake, they must be summoned back again).

&gt;On the other side is an equally simple story of a president who narrowly won office promising competence, inclusiveness, and conciliation but who delivered instead inflation, unemployment, power outages, fuel shortages, autocracy, sectarianism, and divisive rhetoric. Offering meaningless dialogues without the hint of concessions, his erstwhile allies have all abandoned him. And as the ranks of his critics have grown to the extent that they clearly have come to speak for the vast majority of Egyptians, the society has quite simply withdrawn confidence in him as president. Rather than following the text of a constitution that the president's party rammed through for its own purposes -- a constitution that would force the country through three more years of deterioration and despair -- Morsi should leave office now and allow the people to pick new leadership.

There are a few factors that seem to have led up to the recent protests. First, the opposition narrative, typically held by a disorganized mass that could never really get on the same page about anything consisting of leftists, labor leaders, youth movements, and the remnants of the Mubarak-era National Democratic Party, finally seems to have unified and expanded outside of its traditional base. More significantly, this narrative has become increasingly violent. Both sides increasingly see their visions for society threatened by the opposition, which is making compromise increasingly difficult. Due to all of the aforementioned issues, the military has seemed more primed than usual to intervene. In a transitional period into democratic governance, these types of events are more common than not. I think protests (though maybe not quite to this scale) will be semi-frequent over the next several years as the role of elements of society (Islam, the military, and the economy) come to take shape. It is a troubling time, for sure, but I don't believe the Egyptian experiment in democracy, even should there be a coup, be anywhere near over.",2778,5,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

&gt; Why are people upset with them and why don't they just vote for new leadership? Wouldn't that be better than instituting martial law and a temporary military state

Even with new leadership, they're bound by the same Constitution that Morsi's party wrote. Also, in many countries like Egypt, Pakistan, even the US....the military is a more respected institution than the police or the government. Martial Law in Egypt was gentler than Mubarak's rule and for an impious twenty-something, probably more livable than the Muslim Brotherhood as well.

Isn't there a better way to do Senators? The purpose of the Senate, as I understand it, is *deliberation*. They're the 'brakes' on the roadster of PerpetuaFundraising house representatives. In theory the longer term makes them less beholden to the special interests, but the reality of the campaign cycle tends to belie that ideal in prqctise these days, IMO...

"A: there were reasons that senate elections pre-17th were particularly corrupt.  being a senator in 1910 gave you a lot of power in washington, which made it a very desirable thing to be, but very little power in your state, because state level power came from state patronage, which senators couldn't control.  moreover, the 6 year term meant that the state legislature could exercise essentially no control over a senator once he was seated.  even if an individual state legislator was still around in 6 years, his party or faction might be out of power.  This combination meant that legislatures controlled, in the words of a famous governor, ""[a fucking valuable thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Blagojevich)"" but didn't much care who got the seat.  this meant they were pretty free to auction it to the highest bidder, with little worry about the consequences, and they did so.  repealing the 17th directly would just create the same dynamic, my solution wouldn't.

I'm happy to agree to disagree. I don't see any benefit in a lifetime appointment. The Supreme court is extremely political, and the idea that they are not seems to me to be forced. They constantly rule on and change politics in this country. It's all they do, really. They don't preside over common criminals or land disputes - they re-write law with every single decision. It does not get more political, and many times their decisions - while they are supposed to be based in law - are seemingly made for no legal reason at all.

Just my opinion.","The benefit I see is that it makes the sitting judges as apolitical as possible; as much as every appointment stirs endless talking about 'litmus tests' and whatnot, ultimately it's a position that gets filled largely on the candidate's judicial bonafides over their politics.

&gt;Calling someone who supports redistribution a socialist, I can maybe see, but honestly in the US even that's a little more extreme..

I can't disagree enough. For some reason people who push socialist or communist ideas insist you can't call those ideas socialist or communist because it is insulting to them. But they are not insults, they are descriptions of political philosophies. The idea that a person needs to demand a full take over of the private sector in one day in order to be called a socialist or communist is, in my opinion, a semantic argument at best. And by setting some kind of arbitrary limit on the conversation like ""You can't use socialist or communist"" seems to me to not only be unfair but also stifling to conversation.

&gt;. I'm not trying to play the 'that's not what that word really means!' game, as these things are hardly set and stone and a words' use ultimately dictates its definition (I for one am a big fan of progress and individual freedom, but Progressive Liberal no longer means what it once did)... It's just that communism is an extreme word that we rob of its usefulness as we overuse it. The exact same thing happens on the left with Fascism. Regardless of how annoyed we might be with our current government, it bears no resemblance to either fascism or communism, and we betray a severe lack of perspective by using those terms so cavalierly.

I think ""Racist"" ""Xenophobic"" ""Homophobic"" and many more like it are used far mote cavalierly today. You seem to be towing the line with your commentary here, and I understand why to an extent. Just labeling something ""Communist"" or ""Socialist"" or ""Fascist"" without explaining why you are calling it that is an issue, I agree. But I also agree that there are many levels involved and that the terms cover a spectrum not a narrow band of behavior.

&gt;Also, where did I say I voted for Obama?

My mistake then. I thought you said you voted for him the second time. I respect a Johnson vote, as well as an Obama vote or a Romney vote. What I respect the least is the 94 million who do not bother to vote. I do think it is their right to abstain and would never support a forced vote like they have in Australia, but I also find that to be a bigger problem than anything else in politics.",5193,38,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

&gt; It&amp;#039;s the latest voting rights controversy to crop up in the Georgia governor&amp;#039;s race, which pits Republican Kemp against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who if elected would become the first African American woman governor of any state.

&gt; &amp;quot;Brian Kemp has abused his power as secretary of state of Georgia to purge the voting rolls of Georgia primarily of black and brown people,&amp;quot; said Joe Beasley, an Atlanta civil rights activist.

If they don’t return it, they are marked inactive. If they don’t vote for two more general elections after that, they are removed from the rolls.*

&amp;#x200B;

So...**5 years** the voter had to confirm residency - after 3 years of not voting, they are given ""suspended registration"" during which time they can still vote. If they do, their registration is validated and current.  And u/ieattime20 would have you believe that registrants shouldn't be bothered to vote, much less maintain their public records.

Then Kemp used it again.

Two, this method of purging due to inactivity is not automatic. It was initiated by Kemp in election year. And it's clearly a bad method, as its goal was to remove only voters that moved to other precincts and guess what? It didn't. Maybe not sending out a single small postcard to an address you don't think is correct is a better way to go, as these people routinely say they never got notice.

Three and finally, *you do not have to perform arbitrary nonfunctional and bad faith rituals to retain your fundamental rights*. Given the voting rate in the United States, *any* law that purges voters due to inactivity has to result in less voter registration. Voting is not mandatory, but it *is not a privilege, it is a right*.

Again, El would have you believe that Kemp, in the tightest race for governorship in the country, using methods that the State settled out of court and agreed it wouldn't use, in his own election, with the result of *hundreds of thousands of people* being purged for having moved when they did not move, is acting in good faith.

No shit. 

&gt;Voting is not mandatory, but it is not a privilege, it is a right.

And a right that relies on accurate public records. If a person doesn't take the time and effort to ensure his/her public records are correct, they have no room to bitch and moan about not being able to participate in an action that *requires* proof of individuality. It isn't that hard a concept.

Well yeah they purged people who hadn't moved. So the policy lacks solvency. Provided the intent of the policy is actually at stake here,and not some other intent.
&gt;The SCOTUS ruled that no response from the registrant related to Georgia's purge notifications is legal and in accordance with the 1973 Voting Rights Act. Nice try though.

The basis for that ruling is that, even though inactivity alone is not enough to forego your voting registration, if that inactivity is done in the pursuit of keeping accurate voting records for purposes of determining if someone moves (i.e. they have to send at least a notice) then it is legal. Again, the basis *matters* in the courts El.

Issues that have arisen in past discussions include:

* In rhetorical circles, the *appeal to authority* is often considered a logical fallacy. Politics is not like science, where the work of people with experience has, by definition, undergone rigorous scientific scrutiny and testing. People with political degrees and/or experience in the field are often dead wrong, and it's only history that judges them. In fact, the history of government is littered with ""experts"" who turned out to be completely wrong.
* r/NeutralPolitics is supposed to be an evidence-based sub. If a comment doesn't link to a reliable source, then you should discount it, no matter who posted it. But conversely, if the comment is from someone who has no degree in the field, but links to reliable sources and forms a coherent argument, it should get upvoted. Flair could easily disrupt this system.
* How do you determine expertise? As an example, what happens if you get a learned economist who is schooled in a perspective that, although well-researched, is a minority view in the field. If you give him the ""economist"" flair, does that help or hinder readers when they see him arguing with someone who is not flaired, but is liberally quoting experts from a more mainstream school of thought? It would be easy in that case to favor the flaired commenter, even though his views might be on the fringe.
* The goal of the sub is to promote discussion so that people can make up their own minds about issues. We have no delusions that we're going to solve the world's problems here. To foster an inclusive discussion environment, everyone who provides good evidence and logic should be treated equally.
* We'd probably have to exempt the mods, a few of whom created this environment, but have no advanced degrees in the fields discussed here.

A statesman differs from a professor in a university; the latter has only the general view of society; the former, the statesman, has a number of circumstances to combine with those general ideas"".

The academy tends to be partial to formalized procedures, general abstract principles, theoretical reasoning, rational constructions and well defined stated rules - that approach to politics was famously the object of a devastating critique by Oakeshott in his ""Rationalism in Politics"".

There's a fundamental difference to science: there is no positive, value-free, politics. Even if one was to argue that there is a positive economics, a correlated field, things can quickly get muddled: imagine a discussion about monopolies. A published doctor in economics affiliated with any mainstream school, will declare that absent a horizontal demand curve, some degree of monopolistic distortion will necessarily exist. Some layman who has read a few authors from Rothbard, will argue otherwise. What if in another thread the one making the case for the mainstream is a layman and there's a PhD in economics affiliated with the Austrian school claiming otherwise?

The overall probability is then the sum of wave functions with a peak within a standard deviation of one over those without.  Whether this would go to 1 as a general rule is too complicated to formulate here, but I wouldn't count on it.

* [This article](http://www.infoplease.com/news/2014/scotland-independence-referendum.html) about the 'no' vote on the 2014 Scottish independence referendum specifically states that a ""margin of victory of 10% is decisive.""

The program failed to find him and had a detrimental effect on the efforts to eradicate polio because it bred mistrust of health care workers.

As such, this operation seems like a complete failure. However, even if Osama bin Laden was the most wanted man in the world, and an elusive target, can programs such as these be justifiable?

And what about the use of resources? Can anyone be held accountable for wasteful programs like these when they're largely kept secret? It begs the question ""where are the auditors?"" both financial and moral?","A large problem in our government right now is that external auditors aren't allowed to exist with anything deemed secret.

"C: &gt; A large problem in our government right now is that external auditors aren't allowed to exist with anything deemed secret.

This actually isn't true (assuming you consider Congress to be ""external"" to the executive branch).

When the Cold War wound down, Congress put a great deal of pressure on the intelligence community to reduce waste and ensure mission success. Organizations like the NSA and NRO used to have black budgets with zero oversight outside of the executive branch. For the last 20 years, Congressional subcommittees have had direct oversight over classified budgets, and there's an apparatus in place that performs detailed legal, budgetary, and technical auditing of DoD and intelligence programs (the technical auditors are called FFRDCs). They exist outside the chain of military and intelligence command and appropriations, and their goals are to ensure mission success, reduce waste, and ensure the taxpayer is getting what Congress thinks it's paying for. In terms of success metrics, the auditing system works extremely well for most programs (e.g., US rocket launch success rates are significantly more successful than launches in other countries)

When we examine the details of the recent scandals, most of the real problems are when those high up in the government circumvent auditors. In the case of the (arguably illegal) [Trailblazer Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailblazer_Project), the original legal authorization came from documents drawn up by a non-government lawyer of VP Dick Cheney's, and then that program was separated from the regular auditing chains (there was a great recent NPR piece on this). The NSA was being explicitly told to do what it was doing, and the executive branch was telling it that their legal team had determined that their program was legal. When several NSA employees realized that the program must be illegal, their attempts to warn the auditors were squelched after being run up the chain of command to President Bush, VP Cheney, and then-Congressman Goss.

","I made this comment on the Guardian Article source below, so I will add it here as well:


I would just like to note that the source for this information in the link is their own investigation they note ""A guardian investigation has found"".

I'm not saying it isn't true, but [The Guardian was founded with an agenda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian).

Just something to watch out for with sources. 

This falls under our [guidelines for sources](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_source_quality):

###Source quality

* The preferred sources are academic articles from neutral organizations.
* Wikipedia should not be cited by an OP as the primary or solitary source. You can cite Wikipedia, but it can't be the only thing there.
* If your source is a news article, the publication should not be overly biased.
* Opinion pieces are tricky. Generally speaking, they don't generate useful discussion, but there are times when a well-referenced, unbiased exploration of an issue gets published as an opinion piece and does provide a good starting point. If your opinion piece itself doesn't provide sources, forget about posting it. 
* If your source is a book, link to a good summary or extensive review.
* Video sources are held to the same standards as text sources.
* No hearsay. The article must either contain a direct quote or a link to a direct quote that substantiates the position being attributed to the speaker. So, you can't call someone an anarchist unless you cite a quote where he calls himself an anarchist. (Thanks to /u/insomniaclyric for [proposing](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/17z8tj/meta_guidelines_for_source_quality_and_neutrality/c8afdsc) this rule.)

We do not maintain a ""blacklist"" of sources, because experience has shown that good articles occasionally show up in unlikely places. However, it is the responsibility of the poster or commenter to know the source's reputation and use extra care if quoting from a publication that's widely considered to be biased. It helps to point out that bias in your post too.

Re: operational significance

While it's true that Osama bin Laden's direct influence had waned by the time he died, it's important to keep in mind that we're not exactly fighting a normal war here. The wars in the Middle East are just as much wars of ideas as they are wars of ... well, shooting dudes. bin Laden's significance was not only in that he directed al Qaeda, but in that he was a symbol for al Qaeda - as [Bruce Riedel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Riedel) points out in [this article in the Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/how-the-killing-of-bin-laden-has-crippled-al-qaeda/256505/): 

&gt;There is no question a year after bin Laden's death that the al-Qaida core has been devastated by his loss, because he had achieved mythic status as the Robin Hood of international terrorism who the sheriff couldn't catch, and at the time of his death he was still the boss who ran the organization and kept its archives ... Now that myth has been destroyed and bin Laden has been brought to justice.

The article also points out that the organization has effectively been crippled by this - Osama bin Laden's replacement, al-Zawahiri, is nowhere near as effective as a symbol for new recruits. You can here another publication's take on that [here](http://www.dw.de/al-qaeda-still-suffers-from-bin-ladens-death/a-15921824). Key quote:

&gt;Osama bin Laden had a personality that was able to attract many young men in the Arabic world and also in the West and South Asia. Ayman al-Zawahiri is not inspiring. He is respected but he is not loved like bin Laden was.

And if you really want conventional success out of this operation, the Atlantic additionally points out -

&gt;[g]iven the treasure trove of intelligence gathered during the operation, it is probably no coincidence that the raid was followed by a series of successful strikes against senior bin Laden lieutenants....In fact, in roughly the last year U.S. intelligence officials claim to have killed half of al-Qaida's top 20 leaders in raids and attacks by armed drones...

Basically, tl;dr - Osama bin Laden absolutely should've been considered our top priority despite not having active operational significance. He was still their celebrity leader, and killing him removes a big symbol to any who wished to join him. As Riedel alluded to, it's hard to believe in Robin Hood's victory after he's been shot. 

Of course, there's a new problem of al-Qaeda affiliates becoming more empowered and separated. But  as these groups become more separated, I think they'll be much less effective. Feel free to challenge that opinion though, you never know how these things will develop.

Weighing the deaths of those unvaccinated against the lives  saved  by the war -

It's *really* hard  to make that  comparison when you're crafting policy. It's not like the CIA planned to sacrifice so many polio afflicted children to kill Osama bin Laden - if the plan goes well, then no innocents die as a result of distrust of vaccines, and the war is over sooner and we accomplish a primary military goal. If it doesn't, then we dismiss the claims as a conspiracy and hope people continue to get vaccines (and maybe radicals preventing them from doing so gets us more support in the war). 

Even if it was thought of as a direct trade off, it's really hard to predict the human lives lost and saved by ""some radicals become anti-vax"" and ""Osama bin Laden goes away"".  While it's easy to predict *some* or *many* will die, it's not as if there are clear results of these scenarios that can be drawn from  counter factuals before the  operation. 

----
Again, I think the operation was a mistake, and probably shouldn't have happened. I just don't think it's an inherently unjustified operation - if we had pulled it off, gotten information about Osama bin Laden, and not been discovered ( as was very possible ) this would have been amazingly helpful. 

It's worth remembering that [the operation Wikipedia lists was set up in Abbottabad, after we suspected bin Laden of hiding there, the year we killed him.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency#Use_of_vaccination_programs) We weren't just dicking around here. On the other hand, you can just as easily say the program wasn't needed at that point - in hindsight, I'd agree. I'm just not to upset we did it. 

So blah, that's my opinion. Sorry for lengthy post, got interested in this  subject and was bored!

Have at it!","**Question 1:** The US is a big country with diverse and shifting interests. This brings complexity and nuance to the issues our representatives deal with in Washington. Does the whole idea of asking them to ""pledge"" something before they're elected lead to good policy? It seems like the resulting inflexibility would be a hindrance to good governance. 

**Answer:** It's a good question. People often say, The Americans for Tax Reform, the group that I head, asks all candidates for office — Federal, State, governors, state legislators, congressmen, senators, presidents — to sign a pledge to the American people, to the people of their state, and to the country, that they will oppose and vote against any effort to raise the tax burden, to raise taxes. The reason we do so is that the tendency of politicians is to expand the power of the government — State government, Federal government, city government — at the expense of consumers and taxpayers and citizens. And so, this is a commitment, saying, 'If I run for office, I may do many foolish things; I may invade small countries I can't pronounce, but I will not raise your taxes.' It doesn't answer all the world's questions, but it gets at quite a few of them. And the reason why you want to say to people, ""don't raise taxes,"" or you want them to make the commitment if they're willing to — I don't want someone promising you they won't raise taxes if they intend to raise taxes; the pledge is important and useful because people keep it when they run for office, and they make that commitment or they don't — 

The Constitution, as an example, is a collection of things the government is *not allowed to do.* There's a small list of things the government is supposed to do, and then a long list of amendment, the 10 parts of the Bill of Rights, are all things the government's not allowed to do.

"B: **Question 1:** The US is a big country with diverse and shifting interests. This brings complexity and nuance to the issues our representatives deal with in Washington. Does the whole idea of asking them to ""pledge"" something before they're elected lead to good policy? It seems like the resulting inflexibility would be a hindrance to good governance. 

**Answer:** It's a good question. People often say, The Americans for Tax Reform, the group that I head, asks all candidates for office — Federal, State, governors, state legislators, congressmen, senators, presidents — to sign a pledge to the American people, to the people of their state, and to the country, that they will oppose and vote against any effort to raise the tax burden, to raise taxes. The reason we do so is that the tendency of politicians is to expand the power of the government — State government, Federal government, city government — at the expense of consumers and taxpayers and citizens. And so, this is a commitment, saying, 'If I run for office, I may do many foolish things; I may invade small countries I can't pronounce, but I will not raise your taxes.' It doesn't answer all the world's questions, but it gets at quite a few of them. And the reason why you want to say to people, ""don't raise taxes,"" or you want them to make the commitment if they're willing to — I don't want someone promising you they won't raise taxes if they intend to raise taxes; the pledge is important and useful because people keep it when they run for office, and they make that commitment or they don't — 

The Constitution, as an example, is a collection of things the government is *not allowed to do.* There's a small list of things the government is supposed to do, and then a long list of amendment, the 10 parts of the Bill of Rights, are all things the government's not allowed to do. They're not allowed to tell you what church to go to. They're not allowed to tell you what you can say or can't say. They're not allowed come and rifle through your papers. They're not allowed to steal your guns or interfere with your Second Amendment rights. There's no ifs, ands or buts on this stuff. They're not allowed to.

OK, but the Constitution says, as Mr. Norquist himself pointed out in a later answer, that the government, through the House of Representatives, *is* allowed to raise taxes. So, he makes a long argument about the applicability of the Constitution, and then seems to indicate that it is, or should be, moot, superseded by the pledge.

Were all those instances of Reagan failing to govern?

To some extent. Ideally those tax increases should have been paid with spending cuts. But Reagan was a President, not an absolutist king. He was very adept of getting legislative bipartisan support for his initiatives, unlike recent Presidents. 

The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act didn't actually raise taxes - it repealed tax cuts that had not yet taken place. The TEFRA passed the House with 226 votes - 123 from Republicans, 123 from Democrats. Reagan agreed to sign into law under the promise from Congress of a $3 reduction in spending for every $1 in increase in revenue. A pretty sweet deal, but Congress failed to deliver. - Source 1 [On the other hand, most of Dole's tax increase was actually the partial repeal of future tax cuts that had been enacted in 1981 but had not yet taken place. Despite Dole's bill, taxpayers received more than $375 billion in tax cuts over the following three years.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_gist/1996/08/the_biggest_tax_increase_in_history.html).

The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 was a bill introduced by a Democrat and sponsored by another 14. It passed the House with 268 to 155 and pretty much like the TEFRA, most of the revenue it raised came from repealing future tax cuts. - Basically the same sources. [1984: The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (HR 4170) represented a substantial step toward deficit reduction, adding $103 billion to revenues over ten years, mainly by closing unwarranted loopholes (...) was enacted by a vote of 268 to 155](http://www.ctj.org/html/gore.htm)

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was another bipartisan bill with the aim of being revenue neutral. Actually, it was the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that prompted the creation of the ATR - as a lobby group with the aim of promoting it.  Source [The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was given impetus by a detailed tax-simplification proposal from President Reagan's Treasury Department, and was designed to be tax-revenue neutral because Reagan stated that he would veto any bill that was not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986) Source [ Americans for Tax Reform was founded in the mid-80s inside the Reagan White House. Norquist was tapped to head the group as an in-house operation to build support for the 1986 tax reform bill](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/americans-for-tax-reform) - 

The other two tax increases mentioned didn't raise any marginal income tax [per the Politifact article cited above - (...)legislation making permanent a 16-cent federal excise tax on a pack of cigarettes... (...) extended the telephone excise tax and eliminated a real estate tax deduction loophole.
)](http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2012/jun/25/gerry-connolly/rep-gerry-connolly-says-reagan-raised-taxes-during/)

The taxpayer's protection pledge states:

&gt; I will: ONE, oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; *and TWO, oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates* [source](http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/Federal%20Pledge.pdf) pdf

That gives Congressmen enough leeway to work on tax restructuring -close loopholes and curb tax code expenditures- without violating the pledge. 

Overall, the tax burden declined during the Reagan Administration and most of the tax increases were repeals of scheduled tax cuts.

Your explanation of why capital gains revenues are expected to rise when taxes goes down does not negate the fact that they do and that Mr. Norquist was correct.

For your Jamie Dimon example you are saying good things in a way that makes them sound like bad things. If it is morally right for a man that makes $1,000 dollars a year to keep and use that money then why is it morally wrong for a man who makes 14 million to keep and use that money?

&gt; Your explanation of why capital gains revenues are expected to rise when taxes goes down does not negate the fact that they do and that Mr. Norquist was correct.

In a sense, yes. He is correct that capital gains revenues rise and fall in response to changes in the capital gains tax rate. I think that's a pretty obvious byproduct of the fluctuation. But he's essentially answering his own question here, since the original quote said nothing about capital gains revenue. It was all about growth or damage to the overall economy.

&gt; If it is morally right for a man that makes $1,000 dollars a year to keep and use that money then why is it morally wrong for a man who makes 14 million to keep and use that money?

It's not morally wrong. But if either man uses that money to earn *more* money, then the gain (not the original principal, just the gain) is new income, and should be taxed as such. ""The same dollar"" should not be taxed. On that I agree with Mr. Norquist. But calling the gain on investment income ""the same dollar"" is misleading.

If the man who makes $1,000 puts that money in the bank, earns 10% interest, and withdraws $1,100 at the end of the year, only the $100 is subject to tax, not the original $1,000. Similarly, I believe Mr. Dimon's $1.4 million annual returns on investment should be taxed, but not the original $14 million invested.

Why should I vote Republican when the party supports a tax code and other governmental powers that put me at a disadvantage? Why do you not present a plan that closes unfair advantages / tax loopholes and have members of congress sign onto that?

**Answer:** Actually, I am in favor of just that. If you're looking at Congressman Dave Camp, is the Republican in the House who runs the Weighs and Means Committee, the tax writing committee. Under the Constitution, only the House can introduce tax changes, up or down or reform. His tax reform moves in exactly that direction. It's not all spelled out, but we have a fairly good idea of the direction they're going and I think you'll be very pleased with the proposal that he puts forward in terms of moving in the right direction. Maybe not as far as you or I would go, but everybody should pay the same marginal tax rates, not different for different people.

We do have a challenge. We have a 35% top corporate rate, OK? I just had a presentation in our Wednesday meeting here in D.C.  There's a gentleman from Hungary who runs a think tank there.

"A: **Question 7:** Which tax deductions would you like to see eliminated from the tax code as part of an effort to ""simplify"" things? Assuming that rates were also cut, but the net result was an increase in revenue, would you score this as a tax increase or a tax decrease?

**Answer:** For the first part, there are lots of tax deductions that I think I would rather move away from and have lower rates. One proposal that was put forward I think years ago by Steven Moore - now writing for The Wall Street Journal editorial page - which was to set up an alternative tax code. So you have the present tax code which is a mess and has thousands of pages and a second tax code [that is] optional, optional [where if] you like the present system? Stay there. Be happy. You want to move over to the other one permanently - you can't do it one year and then change back and forth - but you can choose the other one and have one simple rate and few, if any, deductions in credits. So you could go very radical in the limitation on how many deductions and credits you have because it's an option. I would like to live in a world where the government doesn't advantage or disadvantage any activities, one simple very low rate, and I think most people over time would in fact shift to the low rate with few deductions or credits. I realize that some people have organized their lives by how they've structured things, by buying a big house, and other stuff that you do because they're tax advantages. Well, over time you might want to shift and not live for the tax rules but live for how you want to make decisions not how tax writing committees want to make decisions for you. So I think that that it would be a good idea to move towards few deductions and credits but I like that idea of making it an option. You want to stay in the present mess? You can. The rest of us may want to move over to the simpler code system. But it doesn't scare anybody because if somebody thinks ""Oh, I've got this tax credit that's important to me"" then please, stay there. Nobody's telling you that you have to do anything other than what you're doing.

Answer for Part 2:

Tax reductions/tax cuts taking the top rate from 90/70, from 70/50, from 50/20, every time we did those things the government would have more money from rich people because people paid more in taxes because they worked more and because they didn't try and organize their lives around hiding from the tax rates. And so that actually raises revenue but it is a tax cut. I don't think you can look somebody in the eye and say ""We're going to tax you at 90, we're now going to tax you at 70 and that's a tax increase"". It's a tax rate cut that, actually because of economic growth, helps the entire economy and the government ends up raising more money with a lower rate. So, cutting the capital gains tax and cutting the income tax rates, cutting the business tax rates, going to faster depreciation or expensing for business investment, all those things are cuts in taxes but they actually raise money for the government because they're so helpful to strengthening the overall economy.","That first answer terrifies me, and I hope he didn't think that through.

How do you justify your stance opposing the regulation of health care considering the current comparatively large expenditure of your nation's GDP on health care?

**Answer:** OK, one, wealthy nations like to spend more on health care because they can, because they can afford it. I think it's a good thing to spend money on health care — not unnecessarily, but it's a good sign. People living longer, you know, 70 and 80 year-olds spend more on health care than 20 year-olds, and we have more 70 and 80 year-olds than we used to have, because people are living longer. This is a *good* thing, not a bad thing. I know the Social Security actuarial people think it's a bad thing, but they're wrong. It's a good thing to have lots of older people, because someday, I hope to be one, and I intend to spend lots on health care when I get there. But, we don't want to waste any money on health care, but we also don't want to do what these nice people in Europe that you're [referencing are doing], which is rationing. Which is telling people, ""Well, we're not telling you you can't have your kidney operation, we're just telling you you're going to have to get in line and it's going to take months, and you may not live that long. That's rationing, by putting people in lines, and you don't want the government rationing care, you want a competitive... now, I'm very unhappy with both Obamacare — more government control with fewer options, and people are whining because Obama's law has gotten a whole bunch of insurance companies to cancel their policies because they're illegal, because the government says 'policies have to have x, y and z in them,' and they make them too expensive for anybody to buy, so they cancel them. The government ought not be in the business of telling you what your insurance should look like. You should decide.

But, if Obamacare had never happened, we had a mess before Obamacare. It wasn't as big a mess, but it was still a mess. And you had 50 states — some people say 57, but at least 50 states — where each of those states set up a bunch of rules, and said 'if you want to sell insurance in New Jersey,' there were I think 48 different mandates: you have to insure for this and this.

Well, what if I don't want to insure for all sorts of different things and uh, drug rehabilitation. I don't want to pay for that because it's not something I'm going to make use of, or for various other things that I'm not interested in? I want to be able to choose what I insure for, not have the government tell me I have to. And the reason some states, like New Jersey, have more than Iowa, is that the legislature, and so on, are more corrupt, and they've got all these special interests coming in saying, ""make everybody who buys insurance use my stuff."" And that's where these mandates come in. And Obama did that in a big way with Obamacare. There's lots of stuff you have to pay for that you may have no interest in that subsidizes some special interest because Obama's rule-makers make you pay for something you don't want to pay for, and that raises the cost.

So, we should keep costs low. We should allow people to buy insurance anywhere they want to and from any state, from any business they want to, and not have rules. Right now Obamacare, the government has to approve your insurance. Well screw them. It's not their insurance, it's your insurance. It's my insurance.

The government ought not be in the business of telling you what your insurance should look like. You should decide.

But, if Obamacare had never happened, we had a mess before Obamacare. It wasn't as big a mess, but it was still a mess. And you had 50 states — some people say 57, but at least 50 states — where each of those states set up a bunch of rules, and said 'if you want to sell insurance in New Jersey,' there were I think 48 different mandates: you have to insure for this and this.

Well, what if I don't want to insure for all sorts of different things and uh, drug rehabilitation. I don't want to pay for that because it's not something I'm going to make use of, or for various other things that I'm not interested in? I want to be able to choose what I insure for, not have the government tell me I have to. And the reason some states, like New Jersey, have more than Iowa, is that the legislature, and so on, are more corrupt, and they've got all these special interests coming in saying, ""make everybody who buys insurance use my stuff."" And that's where these mandates come in. And Obama did that in a big way with Obamacare. There's lots of stuff you have to pay for that you may have no interest in that subsidizes some special interest because Obama's rule-makers make you pay for something you don't want to pay for, and that raises the cost.

So, we should keep costs low. We should allow people to buy insurance anywhere they want to and from any state, from any business they want to, and not have rules. Right now Obamacare, the government has to approve your insurance. Well screw them. It's not their insurance, it's your insurance. It's my insurance. We should be able to decide what we pay for and what we want, not the government.

"C: The first couple sentences of that response are an egregious sidestep of the question.  We are a younger country with lower life expectancy than many of the countries with fully socialized health care, yet we spend more than them per capita for less coverage and poorer outcomes.  Just one source among many from a cursory Google search:

http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Fund-Reports/2010/Jun/Mirror-Mirror-Update.aspx?page=all","Good point.

Somewhat off topic, but I would like to raise the seldom raised point that the one reason health care is so expensive in America is the shortage of doctors. Medical schools currently have a 3% acceptance rate. They are turning away 'straight A students'. This number only reflects the number that applied and ignores the multitudes that don`t even apply, scared of the 60K+ per semester tuition costs.

Its simple supply and demand. We need nurse practitioners to take over primary care as a quick fix but long term we need more doctors. We need more medical schools. We need to lower education costs.

Its no secret; the AMA is against opening new schools and has been for a while. I don't blame them with the average salary of 250k-500k a year as an MD I would be against training new competition too.

"B: There's one thing those studies never measure: other systems ability to free-ride the medical innovation that American's market enhances. 

Secondly, there are many things affecting life expectancy besides the quality of the medical care: violent deaths, race and cultural habits (e.g nutritional habits).

Every source of energy should be allowed to compete on a level playing field."" Can you expand upon ATR's goal of expanding America's energy supply?

**Answer:** That got to the earlier question we were talking about where I oppose, and Americans for Tax Reform opposes, all special subsidies, tax breaks, for particular industries. There are a whole bunch of subsidies for so-called green energy or alternative energy sources, and some tax breaks for oil or natural gas. Get rid of all that stuff. Get rid of all of those special deals, and just say, 'hey, you want to bring natural gas or oil or nuclear or wind power or magic bean power or whatever you've got and sell it to people, then do so, but don't be asking for a subsidy; just do it.'

So I think it's very important that we... now there's a lot of stuff... fracking... we can now find natural gas in places nobody thought they had it before. All sorts of States are doing it. New York has decided not to do it in New York, but in Pennsylvania a lot of people are producing... 10 percent of the natural gas in the country is now being made in Pennsylvania, which did not used to be thought of as some cross between Qatar and Kuwait or something, but Pennsylvania is now doing quite well. A lot of people are getting rich... farmers and stuff, 'cause they have to poke a whole in your farmland and they have to pay for it.

So, I think there's some great stuff. There's a lot of energy in Alaska and the Alaskans get very whiny when a bunch of rich liberals sitting in New York City who've never been to Alaska decide that they can't poke holes in the ground in Alaska and get oil and sell it to people. I think that's kind of silly and it's kind of imperialistic to run other people's lives from afar and tell them what they can and can't do with their own property and their own stuff.

So, I think we should be drilling off shore. The only way California's ever going to get out of its bankrupt situation, where the underfunded liabilities of the government worker pension system, which is bankrupting the state — and it's gotten worse, not better, under Governor Brown and recent situations — is to tap all that lovely underground oil and natural gas that's off shore, like they do in Britain and Norway. But very carefully, making sure you don't damage any birds or anything, but that would solve much, if not all of, the California problem that's otherwise going to break the taxpayers of the State, or move everybody with a job to Arizona, Nevada and Wyoming.

So, I think there's a lot we can do on energy. The government just has to get out of their way. The government doesn't have to do anything. You've got a project, 'I've got a project.' What does it require? The government's got to be really smart and... whoops, that's not gonna work, is it? If all the government has to do is get out of the way, your project might work and energy independence, meaning producing as much energy as we want, the idea being that we should be worried about buying energy from Mexico or Canada has always struck me as vaguely stupid. Okay, we don't need to be completely independent of other places, but let's not be unnecessarily requiring to buy energy from other countries if we could produce it here.

Regarding rule B, asking the question ""How hard was it to...?"" is rather leading. A better way to ask would be, for example, ""What was the drive behind passing HIPAA, and what were the challenges facing legislators who wanted in enacted?"" This encourages discussion of both sides of the issue, rather than just the difficulty. Also, the editorialized comments (""it seems almost miraculous..."", ""I'm amazed that HIPAA goes back to '96"", etc.) are inherently non-neutral.

Regarding rule D, that journal article would be helpful for discussing the ACA, but, as you stated, it will need to be in reference to controversy around health care policy. A source besides Wikipedia that discusses the history behind HIPAA would also be very helpful; HHS.gov provides a good overview of when HIPAA came into play and what it covers. Archived news sources from around that time may also be good, if you can find them. The References section on the Wikipedia page would be a good place to start. Since you're also discussing the Equifax scandal, you should provide a source or two (not Wikipedia) on that, as well.

How this isn't obstruction of Justice on its own is baffling. This goes beyond just Trump and the Russia investigation. 
 
He is discrediting any and every investigation conducted on any politician, especially those where a Democrat was not convicted and where a republican was convicted. So say the FBI starts investigating a certain money frail that goes from a foreign entity in to a 501c that makes its way to a republican candidate. If the FBI investigates that candidate and it leaks to the public, the opinion of the president is already out there and his supporters will automatically believe its a witch hunt because ""the FBI leadership is bias against Republicans"" when it very well could in fact be a foreign government throwing money in our elections. What if a Democrat is accused of the same thing but there's no evidence of it? If the FBI doesn't publicly disclose their investigation of it or refused to, the whole ""see they're biased!"" can be dragged out. 
 
That's the real fucked up part. The FBI can't do its job unless it's easy on Republicans and harsh on democrats. I wonder if this will stop at politicians and not trickle down to individuals being investigated and they won't be asked or have their political activity researched.

"C: This is provably true. The FBI does tend to leave Democrats alone more than they leave Republicans alone. However, it's not for the reasons Trump thinks.

It's for the simple reason that the Republican party, in the executive branch, has a history (at least for the last 60 years) of violating the law much, much, much more often than the Democrats in the executive branch.

If you go by convictions, the tendency of Republican executive branch member vs Democrat executive branch members is on the line of [89 Republican *convictions* to 1 Democrat *conviction*](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/79b4z2/robert_muellers_office_will_serve_first/dp0khrf/). This means it left the FBI, ended up in court, and the court system *also* found these Republicans guilty of breaking the law.

So, yes, the FBI goes after Republicans more than Democrats because Democrats seem to respect the law, and Republicans find this whole ""rule of law"" thing inconvenient and unnecessary (for them).

So is that not the FBI showing favor?","&gt; another person in a similar situation might not get the same treatment

Well, for one thing, *similar* situation and *same* situation are not the same thing.

1: You're driving down the highway, you car's tire throws a rock off the overpass and it hits a car below, killing the driver.

2: You're driving down the highway and get a flat tire. You pull over, but there's a big rock blocking where you need to put your jack. You toss the rock off the overpass and it hits a car below, killing the driver.

3: You pull over on an overpass. You're bored. You pick up a big rock and see if you can drop it on a car passing below. You hit the car, killing the driver.

4: You know that your ex-husband drives under this exact overpass every day. You've pulled over and watched for him and know he is in the middle lane each time. You get a big rock, and drop it, hitting his car and killing the driver.

Four situations where a rock kills a driver. 1 is not even a crime. 2 through 4 are.

If I'm Fox News, and Hillary Clinton was in situation 1, I write a story that says, ""Hillary throws rock from bridge, killing someone. Lock her up.""  If Donald Trump is in situation 3, I write: ""Driver's death was a complete accident. Trump didn't mean to kill anyone"".

Issues that have arisen in past discussions include:

* In rhetorical circles, the *appeal to authority* is often considered a logical fallacy. Politics is not like science, where the work of people with experience has, by definition, undergone rigorous scientific scrutiny and testing. People with political degrees and/or experience in the field are often dead wrong, and it's only history that judges them. In fact, the history of government is littered with ""experts"" who turned out to be completely wrong.
* r/NeutralPolitics is supposed to be an evidence-based sub. If a comment doesn't link to a reliable source, then you should discount it, no matter who posted it. But conversely, if the comment is from someone who has no degree in the field, but links to reliable sources and forms a coherent argument, it should get upvoted. Flair could easily disrupt this system.
* How do you determine expertise? As an example, what happens if you get a learned economist who is schooled in a perspective that, although well-researched, is a minority view in the field. If you give him the ""economist"" flair, does that help or hinder readers when they see him arguing with someone who is not flaired, but is liberally quoting experts from a more mainstream school of thought? It would be easy in that case to favor the flaired commenter, even though his views might be on the fringe.
* The goal of the sub is to promote discussion so that people can make up their own minds about issues. We have no delusions that we're going to solve the world's problems here. To foster an inclusive discussion environment, everyone who provides good evidence and logic should be treated equally.
* We'd probably have to exempt the mods, a few of whom created this environment, but have no advanced degrees in the fields discussed here.

The probability that it will happen to at least one person goes to 1 quickly, but the probability of whether it will happen as a general rule involves many more variables and is better represented by a family of wave functions.  The overall probability is then the sum of wave functions with a peak within a standard deviation of one over those without.  Whether this would go to 1 as a general rule is too complicated to formulate here, but I wouldn't count on it.

Specifically, it needs a source and an adjustment to the title.

The source can simply support your premise. The post begins with, ""I have heard it claimed that..."" Where have you heard it? From whom? Please link to a qualified source (as defined in the guidelines) to support this claim, so all the participants can base their responses on the same information.

For the title, we discourage solicitations of opinion, because it gives people license to respond without evidence. You can just eliminate the ""In your opinion"" from the title and leave the rest. Unfortunately, that means you'll have to resubmit the post, because reddit doesn't allow you to edit titles of submissions.

This is an interesting question and could generate some good discussion. We hope you'll take the time to make those two adjustments and resubmit. If you have any questions, feel free to reply here.

The proposed reframing of the question is more likely to generate simple responses like, ""Yes, it's possible."" There's not much discussion to be had there.

And since you're acknowledging the subjectivity, perhaps instead of a source for the claim, you can just find a couple examples of referendum results that were referred to as ""decisive,"" then present the question of whether there's any kind of real standard.

Here are a few examples I found:

* The results of the recent Greek referendum were [referred to as a ""decisive"" vote for 'no' with 61% of the vote.](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/07/05/greek-referendum-what-a-yes-or-no-vote-could-mean.html)
* [This article](http://www.infoplease.com/news/2014/scotland-independence-referendum.html) about the 'no' vote on the 2014 Scottish independence referendum specifically states that a ""margin of victory of 10% is decisive.""
* The 1969 French referendum on governmental reforms garnered 52.87% 'no' votes, which [this article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/28/newsid_2500000/2500927.stm) calls  ""decisive.""

The program failed to find him and had a detrimental effect on the efforts to eradicate polio because it bred mistrust of health care workers.

As such, this operation seems like a complete failure. However, even if Osama bin Laden was the most wanted man in the world, and an elusive target, can programs such as these be justifiable?

And what about the use of resources? Can anyone be held accountable for wasteful programs like these when they're largely kept secret? It begs the question ""where are the auditors?"" both financial and moral?","A large problem in our government right now is that external auditors aren't allowed to exist with anything deemed secret.

"C: &gt; A large problem in our government right now is that external auditors aren't allowed to exist with anything deemed secret.

This actually isn't true (assuming you consider Congress to be ""external"" to the executive branch).

When the Cold War wound down, Congress put a great deal of pressure on the intelligence community to reduce waste and ensure mission success. Organizations like the NSA and NRO used to have black budgets with zero oversight outside of the executive branch. For the last 20 years, Congressional subcommittees have had direct oversight over classified budgets, and there's an apparatus in place that performs detailed legal, budgetary, and technical auditing of DoD and intelligence programs (the technical auditors are called FFRDCs). They exist outside the chain of military and intelligence command and appropriations, and their goals are to ensure mission success, reduce waste, and ensure the taxpayer is getting what Congress thinks it's paying for. In terms of success metrics, the auditing system works extremely well for most programs (e.g., US rocket launch success rates are significantly more successful than launches in other countries)

When we examine the details of the recent scandals, most of the real problems are when those high up in the government circumvent auditors. In the case of the (arguably illegal) [Trailblazer Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailblazer_Project), the original legal authorization came from documents drawn up by a non-government lawyer of VP Dick Cheney's, and then that program was separated from the regular auditing chains (there was a great recent NPR piece on this). The NSA was being explicitly told to do what it was doing, and the executive branch was telling it that their legal team had determined that their program was legal. When several NSA employees realized that the program must be illegal, their attempts to warn the auditors were squelched after being run up the chain of command to President Bush, VP Cheney, and then-Congressman Goss. 

From my perspective, one of the most concerning things about this whole NSA scandal is that these people did an end run around our legal auditors, and now they aren't being held accountable.",(pass),13341,2,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

I'm not saying it isn't true, but [The Guardian was founded with an agenda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian).

Just something to watch out for with sources. 

This falls under our [guidelines for sources](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_source_quality):

###Source quality

* The preferred sources are academic articles from neutral organizations.
* Wikipedia should not be cited by an OP as the primary or solitary source. You can cite Wikipedia, but it can't be the only thing there.
* If your source is a news article, the publication should not be overly biased.
* Opinion pieces are tricky. Generally speaking, they don't generate useful discussion, but there are times when a well-referenced, unbiased exploration of an issue gets published as an opinion piece and does provide a good starting point. If your opinion piece itself doesn't provide sources, forget about posting it. 
* If your source is a book, link to a good summary or extensive review.
* Video sources are held to the same standards as text sources.
* No hearsay. The article must either contain a direct quote or a link to a direct quote that substantiates the position being attributed to the speaker. So, you can't call someone an anarchist unless you cite a quote where he calls himself an anarchist. (Thanks to /u/insomniaclyric for [proposing](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/17z8tj/meta_guidelines_for_source_quality_and_neutrality/c8afdsc) this rule.)

We do not maintain a ""blacklist"" of sources, because experience has shown that good articles occasionally show up in unlikely places. However, it is the responsibility of the poster or commenter to know the source's reputation and use extra care if quoting from a publication that's widely considered to be biased. It helps to point out that bias in your post too.

Re: operational significance

While it's true that Osama bin Laden's direct influence had waned by the time he died, it's important to keep in mind that we're not exactly fighting a normal war here. The wars in the Middle East are just as much wars of ideas as they are wars of ... well, shooting dudes. bin Laden's significance was not only in that he directed al Qaeda, but in that he was a symbol for al Qaeda - as [Bruce Riedel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Riedel) points out in [this article in the Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/how-the-killing-of-bin-laden-has-crippled-al-qaeda/256505/): 

&gt;There is no question a year after bin Laden's death that the al-Qaida core has been devastated by his loss, because he had achieved mythic status as the Robin Hood of international terrorism who the sheriff couldn't catch, and at the time of his death he was still the boss who ran the organization and kept its archives ... Now that myth has been destroyed and bin Laden has been brought to justice.

The article also points out that the organization has effectively been crippled by this - Osama bin Laden's replacement, al-Zawahiri, is nowhere near as effective as a symbol for new recruits. You can here another publication's take on that [here](http://www.dw.de/al-qaeda-still-suffers-from-bin-ladens-death/a-15921824). Key quote:

&gt;Osama bin Laden had a personality that was able to attract many young men in the Arabic world and also in the West and South Asia. Ayman al-Zawahiri is not inspiring. He is respected but he is not loved like bin Laden was.

And if you really want conventional success out of this operation, the Atlantic additionally points out -

&gt;[g]iven the treasure trove of intelligence gathered during the operation, it is probably no coincidence that the raid was followed by a series of successful strikes against senior bin Laden lieutenants....In fact, in roughly the last year U.S. intelligence officials claim to have killed half of al-Qaida's top 20 leaders in raids and attacks by armed drones...

Basically, tl;dr - Osama bin Laden absolutely should've been considered our top priority despite not having active operational significance. He was still their celebrity leader, and killing him removes a big symbol to any who wished to join him. As Riedel alluded to, it's hard to believe in Robin Hood's victory after he's been shot. 

Of course, there's a new problem of al-Qaeda affiliates becoming more empowered and separated. But  as these groups become more separated, I think they'll be much less effective. Feel free to challenge that opinion though, you never know how these things will develop.

Weighing the deaths of those unvaccinated against the lives  saved  by the war -

It's *really* hard  to make that  comparison when you're crafting policy. It's not like the CIA planned to sacrifice so many polio afflicted children to kill Osama bin Laden - if the plan goes well, then no innocents die as a result of distrust of vaccines, and the war is over sooner and we accomplish a primary military goal. If it doesn't, then we dismiss the claims as a conspiracy and hope people continue to get vaccines (and maybe radicals preventing them from doing so gets us more support in the war). 

Even if it was thought of as a direct trade off, it's really hard to predict the human lives lost and saved by ""some radicals become anti-vax"" and ""Osama bin Laden goes away"".  While it's easy to predict *some* or *many* will die, it's not as if there are clear results of these scenarios that can be drawn from  counter factuals before the  operation. 

----
Again, I think the operation was a mistake, and probably shouldn't have happened. I just don't think it's an inherently unjustified operation - if we had pulled it off, gotten information about Osama bin Laden, and not been discovered ( as was very possible ) this would have been amazingly helpful. 

It's worth remembering that [the operation Wikipedia lists was set up in Abbottabad, after we suspected bin Laden of hiding there, the year we killed him.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency#Use_of_vaccination_programs) We weren't just dicking around here. On the other hand, you can just as easily say the program wasn't needed at that point - in hindsight, I'd agree. I'm just not to upset we did it. 

So blah, that's my opinion. Sorry for lengthy post, got interested in this  subject and was bored!

Have at it!","**Question 1:** The US is a big country with diverse and shifting interests. This brings complexity and nuance to the issues our representatives deal with in Washington. Does the whole idea of asking them to ""pledge"" something before they're elected lead to good policy? It seems like the resulting inflexibility would be a hindrance to good governance. 

**Answer:** It's a good question. People often say, The Americans for Tax Reform, the group that I head, asks all candidates for office — Federal, State, governors, state legislators, congressmen, senators, presidents — to sign a pledge to the American people, to the people of their state, and to the country, that they will oppose and vote against any effort to raise the tax burden, to raise taxes. The reason we do so is that the tendency of politicians is to expand the power of the government — State government, Federal government, city government — at the expense of consumers and taxpayers and citizens. And so, this is a commitment, saying, 'If I run for office, I may do many foolish things; I may invade small countries I can't pronounce, but I will not raise your taxes.' It doesn't answer all the world's questions, but it gets at quite a few of them. And the reason why you want to say to people, ""don't raise taxes,"" or you want them to make the commitment if they're willing to — I don't want someone promising you they won't raise taxes if they intend to raise taxes; the pledge is important and useful because people keep it when they run for office, and they make that commitment or they don't — 

The Constitution, as an example, is a collection of things the government is *not allowed to do.* There's a small list of things the government is supposed to do, and then a long list of amendment, the 10 parts of the Bill of Rights, are all things the government's not allowed to do. They're not allowed to tell you what church to go to. They're not allowed to tell you what you can say or can't say. They're not allowed come and rifle through your papers. They're not allowed to steal your guns or interfere with your Second Amendment rights. There's no ifs, ands or buts on this stuff. They're not allowed to. So I think you need restrictions on the power of government, whether it's a democracy or a monarchy, or however you choose your leaders, you want Constitutional restrictions on what that government is allowed to do and what they're forbidden from doing. And the pledge is a way to say, 'By the way, when you elect me, here's what I'm not going to do... I'm not going to raise your taxes.'

And that also tells you a lot about a candidate, because somebody who's not going to raise your taxes has to govern. Governing is making decisions on how much you spend and what you spend it on. Tax increasing is what politicians do rather than govern. 'We've been doing 100 different things, somebody wants to do one more thing... we'll just add it and raise taxes.'

Well, how about making decisions about what's important, what's less important? Are there things you've been doing for the last 20 years that don't make sense any more? Maybe they never made sense. Maybe they made sense 20 or 200 years ago, but not now. And so, the decision not to raise taxes is also the decision to reform government so that it costs less.

The whole thing that drives the Ryan budget plan — the Republican plan to reduce the size and scope of government, to block grant means-tested welfare programs (like Clinton did with Aid to Families with Dependent Children), and to fix entitlements so they don't bankrupt the country in years to come — was all driven by 'how do you do this without raising taxes?' And from that — ""we're not raising taxes"" — we got government reforms that will work and that I think will be very helpful.

&gt; ...you want Constitutional restrictions on what that government is allowed to do and what they're forbidden from doing. And the pledge is a way to say, 'By the way, when you elect me, here's what I'm not going to do... I'm not going to raise your taxes.'

OK, but the Constitution says, as Mr. Norquist himself pointed out in a later answer, that the government, through the House of Representatives, *is* allowed to raise taxes. So, he makes a long argument about the applicability of the Constitution, and then seems to indicate that it is, or should be, moot, superseded by the pledge. What is the point of arguing that the Constitution has specific things it allows and doesn't if your entire purpose is to disallow one of the things the Constitution specifically allows?

&gt; Tax increasing is what politicians do rather than govern.

[ATR was founded by Grover Norquist at the request of President Reagan,](http://www.atr.org/americans-tax-reform-a2878) but Reagan himself [approved increased taxes](http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2012/jun/25/gerry-connolly/rep-gerry-connolly-says-reagan-raised-taxes-during/) to combat a rising deficit and debt burden. Were all those instances of Reagan failing to govern?

&gt; So, it's very important for somebody to take tax increases off the table, because if you don't take tax increases off the table, you never get to reforming government. It just never happens. And, go through history.

Were all those instances of Reagan failing to govern?

To some extent. Ideally those tax increases should have been paid with spending cuts. But Reagan was a President, not an absolutist king. He was very adept of getting legislative bipartisan support for his initiatives, unlike recent Presidents. 

The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act didn't actually raise taxes - it repealed tax cuts that had not yet taken place. The TEFRA passed the House with 226 votes - 123 from Republicans, 123 from Democrats. Reagan agreed to sign into law under the promise from Congress of a $3 reduction in spending for every $1 in increase in revenue. A pretty sweet deal, but Congress failed to deliver. - Source 1 [On the other hand, most of Dole's tax increase was actually the partial repeal of future tax cuts that had been enacted in 1981 but had not yet taken place. Despite Dole's bill, taxpayers received more than $375 billion in tax cuts over the following three years.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_gist/1996/08/the_biggest_tax_increase_in_history.html).

The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 was a bill introduced by a Democrat and sponsored by another 14. It passed the House with 268 to 155 and pretty much like the TEFRA, most of the revenue it raised came from repealing future tax cuts. - Basically the same sources. [1984: The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (HR 4170) represented a substantial step toward deficit reduction, adding $103 billion to revenues over ten years, mainly by closing unwarranted loopholes (...) was enacted by a vote of 268 to 155](http://www.ctj.org/html/gore.htm)

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was another bipartisan bill with the aim of being revenue neutral. Actually, it was the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that prompted the creation of the ATR - as a lobby group with the aim of promoting it.  Source [The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was given impetus by a detailed tax-simplification proposal from President Reagan's Treasury Department, and was designed to be tax-revenue neutral because Reagan stated that he would veto any bill that was not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986) Source [ Americans for Tax Reform was founded in the mid-80s inside the Reagan White House. Norquist was tapped to head the group as an in-house operation to build support for the 1986 tax reform bill](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/americans-for-tax-reform) - 

The other two tax increases mentioned didn't raise any marginal income tax [per the Politifact article cited above - (...)legislation making permanent a 16-cent federal excise tax on a pack of cigarettes... (...) extended the telephone excise tax and eliminated a real estate tax deduction loophole.
)](http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2012/jun/25/gerry-connolly/rep-gerry-connolly-says-reagan-raised-taxes-during/)

The taxpayer's protection pledge states:

&gt; I will: ONE, oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; *and TWO, oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates* [source](http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/Federal%20Pledge.pdf) pdf

That gives Congressmen enough leeway to work on tax restructuring -close loopholes and curb tax code expenditures- without violating the pledge. 

Overall, the tax burden declined during the Reagan Administration and most of the tax increases were repeals of scheduled tax cuts.

For your Jamie Dimon example you are saying good things in a way that makes them sound like bad things. If it is morally right for a man that makes $1,000 dollars a year to keep and use that money then why is it morally wrong for a man who makes 14 million to keep and use that money?

Mr. Norquist's quote, referring to the general economy, was, ""Whenever we raise the capital gains tax, it's been damaged.""

In a sense, yes. He is correct that capital gains revenues rise and fall in response to changes in the capital gains tax rate. I think that's a pretty obvious byproduct of the fluctuation. But he's essentially answering his own question here, since the original quote said nothing about capital gains revenue. It was all about growth or damage to the overall economy.

&gt; If it is morally right for a man that makes $1,000 dollars a year to keep and use that money then why is it morally wrong for a man who makes 14 million to keep and use that money?

It's not morally wrong. But if either man uses that money to earn *more* money, then the gain (not the original principal, just the gain) is new income, and should be taxed as such. ""The same dollar"" should not be taxed. On that I agree with Mr. Norquist. But calling the gain on investment income ""the same dollar"" is misleading.

If the man who makes $1,000 puts that money in the bank, earns 10% interest, and withdraws $1,100 at the end of the year, only the $100 is subject to tax, not the original $1,000. Similarly, I believe Mr. Dimon's $1.4 million annual returns on investment should be taxed, but not the original $14 million invested.

My group of Americans for Tax Reform are strong advocates of that. It's a good idea and I think that's the way to go: reduce, eliminate deductions, credits, exemptions and take the rates down.

","**Question 5:** Do you believe that there is ever a good time or reason to increase marginal tax rates on people and/or businesses, or are there absolutely no circumstances that would make that preferable to you? 

**Answer:** There are absolutely no circumstances under which it's a good idea to raise marginal taxes. The government is too large now both in Washington, DC and in all 57 states – the government is too big. We need the government smaller; we need tax rates lower; we need taxes lower. Raising taxes at a time when the government's larger than it needs to be -- umm we used to get by with total government less than 10% of the economy -- less than 10% of the economy up until like World War 2, okay? We now got the government swallowing 30%. This is not reasonable; this is unacceptable; this is too big. We can make a list of all the things the government does that they ought not to be doing, uh, and so no, there's no conceivable time when raising taxes would be the right answer to the question.

Both of these positions are unreasonable, and that is why his pledge is unreasonable and therefore destructive to political process.

"A: **Question 6:** As a small business, I pay an income tax of 35% whereas my big business counterparts pay a meek 15% in capital gains tax by way of sophisticated international accounting practices. Why should I vote Republican when the party supports a tax code and other governmental powers that put me at a disadvantage? Why do you not present a plan that closes unfair advantages / tax loopholes and have members of congress sign onto that?

**Answer:** Actually, I am in favor of just that. If you're looking at Congressman Dave Camp, is the Republican in the House who runs the Weighs and Means Committee, the tax writing committee. Under the Constitution, only the House can introduce tax changes, up or down or reform. His tax reform moves in exactly that direction. It's not all spelled out, but we have a fairly good idea of the direction they're going and I think you'll be very pleased with the proposal that he puts forward in terms of moving in the right direction. Maybe not as far as you or I would go, but everybody should pay the same marginal tax rates, not different for different people.

We do have a challenge. We have a 35% top corporate rate, OK? I just had a presentation in our Wednesday meeting here in D.C.  There's a gentleman from Hungary who runs a think tank there. They have a 16 percent marginal tax rate there, in Hungary. We're 35, Hungary's 16. And then, the Swedes were there. There at, I think, 22 percent. Swedes are at 22, we're at 35.

"A: **Question 7:** Which tax deductions would you like to see eliminated from the tax code as part of an effort to ""simplify"" things? Assuming that rates were also cut, but the net result was an increase in revenue, would you score this as a tax increase or a tax decrease?

**Answer:** For the first part, there are lots of tax deductions that I think I would rather move away from and have lower rates. One proposal that was put forward I think years ago by Steven Moore - now writing for The Wall Street Journal editorial page - which was to set up an alternative tax code. So you have the present tax code which is a mess and has thousands of pages and a second tax code [that is] optional, optional [where if] you like the present system? Stay there. Be happy. You want to move over to the other one permanently - you can't do it one year and then change back and forth - but you can choose the other one and have one simple rate and few, if any, deductions in credits. So you could go very radical in the limitation on how many deductions and credits you have because it's an option. I would like to live in a world where the government doesn't advantage or disadvantage any activities, one simple very low rate, and I think most people over time would in fact shift to the low rate with few deductions or credits. I realize that some people have organized their lives by how they've structured things, by buying a big house, and other stuff that you do because they're tax advantages. Well, over time you might want to shift and not live for the tax rules but live for how you want to make decisions not how tax writing committees want to make decisions for you. So I think that that it would be a good idea to move towards few deductions and credits but I like that idea of making it an option. You want to stay in the present mess? You can. The rest of us may want to move over to the simpler code system. But it doesn't scare anybody because if somebody thinks ""Oh, I've got this tax credit that's important to me"" then please, stay there. Nobody's telling you that you have to do anything other than what you're doing.

Answer for Part 2:

Tax reductions/tax cuts taking the top rate from 90/70, from 70/50, from 50/20, every time we did those things the government would have more money from rich people because people paid more in taxes because they worked more and because they didn't try and organize their lives around hiding from the tax rates. And so that actually raises revenue but it is a tax cut. I don't think you can look somebody in the eye and say ""We're going to tax you at 90, we're now going to tax you at 70 and that's a tax increase"". It's a tax rate cut that, actually because of economic growth, helps the entire economy and the government ends up raising more money with a lower rate. So, cutting the capital gains tax and cutting the income tax rates, cutting the business tax rates, going to faster depreciation or expensing for business investment, all those things are cuts in taxes but they actually raise money for the government because they're so helpful to strengthening the overall economy.","That first answer terrifies me, and I hope he didn't think that through.

The government ought not be in the business of telling you what your insurance should look like. You should decide.

But, if Obamacare had never happened, we had a mess before Obamacare. It wasn't as big a mess, but it was still a mess. And you had 50 states — some people say 57, but at least 50 states — where each of those states set up a bunch of rules, and said 'if you want to sell insurance in New Jersey,' there were I think 48 different mandates: you have to insure for this and this.

Well, what if I don't want to insure for all sorts of different things and uh, drug rehabilitation. I don't want to pay for that because it's not something I'm going to make use of, or for various other things that I'm not interested in? I want to be able to choose what I insure for, not have the government tell me I have to. And the reason some states, like New Jersey, have more than Iowa, is that the legislature, and so on, are more corrupt, and they've got all these special interests coming in saying, ""make everybody who buys insurance use my stuff."" And that's where these mandates come in. And Obama did that in a big way with Obamacare. There's lots of stuff you have to pay for that you may have no interest in that subsidizes some special interest because Obama's rule-makers make you pay for something you don't want to pay for, and that raises the cost.

Somewhat off topic, but I would like to raise the seldom raised point that the one reason health care is so expensive in America is the shortage of doctors. Medical schools currently have a 3% acceptance rate. They are turning away 'straight A students'. This number only reflects the number that applied and ignores the multitudes that don`t even apply, scared of the 60K+ per semester tuition costs.

Its simple supply and demand. We need nurse practitioners to take over primary care as a quick fix but long term we need more doctors. We need more medical schools. We need to lower education costs.

Its no secret; the AMA is against opening new schools and has been for a while. I don't blame them with the average salary of 250k-500k a year as an MD I would be against training new competition too.

Every source of energy should be allowed to compete on a level playing field."" Can you expand upon ATR's goal of expanding America's energy supply?

**Answer:** That got to the earlier question we were talking about where I oppose, and Americans for Tax Reform opposes, all special subsidies, tax breaks, for particular industries. There are a whole bunch of subsidies for so-called green energy or alternative energy sources, and some tax breaks for oil or natural gas. Get rid of all that stuff. Get rid of all of those special deals, and just say, 'hey, you want to bring natural gas or oil or nuclear or wind power or magic bean power or whatever you've got and sell it to people, then do so, but don't be asking for a subsidy; just do it.'

So I think it's very important that we... now there's a lot of stuff... fracking... we can now find natural gas in places nobody thought they had it before. All sorts of States are doing it. New York has decided not to do it in New York, but in Pennsylvania a lot of people are producing... 10 percent of the natural gas in the country is now being made in Pennsylvania, which did not used to be thought of as some cross between Qatar and Kuwait or something, but Pennsylvania is now doing quite well. A lot of people are getting rich... farmers and stuff, 'cause they have to poke a whole in your farmland and they have to pay for it.

So, I think there's some great stuff. There's a lot of energy in Alaska and the Alaskans get very whiny when a bunch of rich liberals sitting in New York City who've never been to Alaska decide that they can't poke holes in the ground in Alaska and get oil and sell it to people. I think that's kind of silly and it's kind of imperialistic to run other people's lives from afar and tell them what they can and can't do with their own property and their own stuff.

So, I think we should be drilling off shore. The only way California's ever going to get out of its bankrupt situation, where the underfunded liabilities of the government worker pension system, which is bankrupting the state — and it's gotten worse, not better, under Governor Brown and recent situations — is to tap all that lovely underground oil and natural gas that's off shore, like they do in Britain and Norway. But very carefully, making sure you don't damage any birds or anything, but that would solve much, if not all of, the California problem that's otherwise going to break the taxpayers of the State, or move everybody with a job to Arizona, Nevada and Wyoming.

So, I think there's a lot we can do on energy. The government just has to get out of their way. The government doesn't have to do anything. You've got a project, 'I've got a project.' What does it require? The government's got to be really smart and... whoops, that's not gonna work, is it? If all the government has to do is get out of the way, your project might work and energy independence, meaning producing as much energy as we want, the idea being that we should be worried about buying energy from Mexico or Canada has always struck me as vaguely stupid. Okay, we don't need to be completely independent of other places, but let's not be unnecessarily requiring to buy energy from other countries if we could produce it here.

","Wait - hasn't California turned itself around? Isn't the supermajority Democrat administration having a great time with their budget? That was the impression I was getting from the last couple years of news articles, but I am open to correction.

Also, when Alaska sells all that oil, doesn't the wealth go mostly to private corporations, not the citizens? And isn't a lot of the land with the oil etc federally owned land that gets leased out to oil companies when it *is* drilled, not privately owned land where we're telling people not to drill?

Anyway, energy policy is the one place where I most vehemently disagree with Norquist and the Republicans. There's this thing called ""global warming"" being caused by our addiction to cheap carbon-based energy. the longer we delay dealing with it, the more expensive it will be to deal with it.",11409,81,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

"A: Thanks for seeking more feedback! I'm happy to help you craft a great submission for our sub.

Regarding rule B, asking the question ""How hard was it to...?"" is rather leading. A better way to ask would be, for example, ""What was the drive behind passing HIPAA, and what were the challenges facing legislators who wanted in enacted?"" This encourages discussion of both sides of the issue, rather than just the difficulty. Also, the editorialized comments (""it seems almost miraculous..."", ""I'm amazed that HIPAA goes back to '96"", etc.) are inherently non-neutral.

Regarding rule D, that journal article would be helpful for discussing the ACA, but, as you stated, it will need to be in reference to controversy around health care policy. A source besides Wikipedia that discusses the history behind HIPAA would also be very helpful; HHS.gov provides a good overview of when HIPAA came into play and what it covers. Archived news sources from around that time may also be good, if you can find them. The References section on the Wikipedia page would be a good place to start. Since you're also discussing the Equifax scandal, you should provide a source or two (not Wikipedia) on that, as well.

In general, when posting in /r/NeutralPolitics, there's no need to provide personal background as to why you're asking a certain question. Rather, we need to see the *politically relevant* background of the issue. If you look back through the submissions on the sub, they tend to follow the same format: question (in the title and/or the submission itself), presentation of facts and/or history (with appropriate sources), then question again (usually rephrased or more detailed). It's not a rule for the sub, but it helps to ensure that the rules we have are followed appropriately.

Let me know if you have any more questions. You can edit this post to get the content perfect first, or you can go ahead and submit a new post with edits and a revised title to go through our typical editing process (or possibly get approved straight away), which may be with a different mod.","How's this?
