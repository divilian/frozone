This is the training data for coolbot. As with the data for hotbot it has a source instead of issue label. The originial csv files are in the csv_files directory. The jsonl files, which are produced programmatically from the csv files, are in the jsonl_files directory. Finally, the python files used to make and clean the coolbot data are in the py files directory.

All of the diffrent versions of coolbots training data are just diffrent small changes we've made over time to the training data. Usually I would just edit the data itself but in this case it just turned out to be easy to save each version thats why the names are so long and descriptive.
