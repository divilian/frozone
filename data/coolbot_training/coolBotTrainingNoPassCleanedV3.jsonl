He blindly acquired what documents he could and handed them over to a third party without knowing what info they contained. I'm not going to argue whether the info actually placed anyone at risk, but the fact that he never bothered to check that himself made it a very reckless act that had potential to put people at risk.

That's not what I'd call a neutral source; the sourcing of many of those are less than reputable.\n<RE>: She said there was no sexual contact under oath\nB: He says that when he sees beautiful women he just kisses them, doesn't even wait. He doesn't know whether it's wanted by that point.\n<RE>: So \"doesnt even wait\" as in waits for her to say \"kiss me\"?

There are always individuals misbehaving in crowds. The concern with the Acosta scenario was the mass of people joining in to that sentiment."}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "it's a very small number of people in isolated incidents\n\nIt was like a dozen or so Trump supporters who yelled at Acosta, and none of them actually ever made any kind of physical threat..."}]}]}

The role of private healthcare delivery and the effective ability to \"opt-out\" of the public system by receiving all delivery (including trauma) at private facilities adds to this distinction, single-payer systems have a near universal monopoly on non-elective treatment.\n\nCertainly its accurate to state that the majority of healthcare delivery in Austria is via the single-payer system (as it is in the US, we passed the halfway mark in 2008) but that doesn't make the system single-payer anymore then the US is single-payer because of Medicare and Medicaid."}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Ah, now I understand.

Wikipedia articles only attempt to depict a broad survey of what's notable in each topic, not to give the details of each instance.  \n\nHowever, it seems you are dissatisfied with the level of detail offered in this article on the specifics of the mechanism. If you wish to correct this, you can always be bold, as they say in wikipedia, read up on the reasoning behind these folks' ideas, and include a summary in the article.  This would in turn create a more specific set of arguments for you to critique, rather than a superficial brush off, and it would be of value to anyone in your situation, frustrated with the lack of explanation in the article.\n<RE>: There has been no compelling model to conflict over 50 years of research, well understood economic theory, and common sense.  To suggest that I take a serious look at this is akin to assuring that scientology is perfectly logical upon a careful reading.

Opponents say negotiating the terms of these broad treaties in secret is undemocratic and caters to special interests. On the other hand, \"Trade diplomats argue that secrecy is essential to trade negotiations because policymakers must protect businesses confidential information and build trust among negotiators.\"\n\nSo, I'm wondering if there's a way to negotiate these agreements without so much acrimony and mistrust. How have such agreements been negotiated in the past and were they always controversial?\n<RE>: Another question for those who argue that negotiating terms of these treaties in secret is undemocratic, is there a (structurally or otherwise) difference between trade negotiations between nations and peace negotiations between nations, like the recent Iranian nuclear talks.\nB: Another question for those who argue that negotiating terms of these treaties in secret is undemocratic, is there a (structurally or otherwise) difference between trade negotiations between nations and peace negotiations between nations, like the recent Iranian nuclear talks.\n<RE>: Well, a big part of the objections to the secret trade agreement negotiations is that big business interests are brought into the fold, because they're considered stakeholders. With peace negotiations, the nation states themselves are usually the only parties.\nA: International relations is in an odd spot when it comes to transparency. It's generally less well understood than domestic issues by the voting public, and requires certain tact, things not being overtly stated, and cards played close to the chest. The international system is greatly built on that dynamic.\n<RE>: It's the only way. Think about how impossible it would be to pass a huge set of laws that apply to hundreds of millions of people on multiple continents in dozens of countries and 10+ languages.\nA: Why does it matter whether treaties are negotiated in public or in secret--if it's a good treaty we should ratify it, if not we should reject it.  It's not like anybody is automatically bound to the treaty without having a chance to openly review and ratify it.\n<RE>: In the US, most of the objections come into play when the secretly negotiated trade deal is combined with \"Fast Track\" authority,) meaning the Congress can only vote yes or no, without removing, adding or modifying any terms of the agreement. Even filibusters are prohibited.\n\nIn the case of a multilateral agreement, US lawmakers would then be faced with the considerable risk that the other parties will ratify it and lower trade barriers between them, while the US would be left behind if it failed to ratify. That, in turn, could motivate the legislators to accept an agreement that's less than ideal for the American people.\nA: That would imply treaties cannot be successfully negotiated without Fast Track. Yet according to this excellent explanation of the debate, \"Fast track has been invoked just five times during the two decades it was in effect—for a small minority of the trade agreements reached during that period.\""}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "The trade agreements that were made without FTA were almost always between the US and one other country.

The specific people who belong to a group will favor policies that benefit them - this is the whole point of any conglomerate of a bunch of people, to do something that will provide net benefit to all members greater than what they could each achieve as individuals. If you are not a member of this group the group will have a much weaker tendency to pursue policies in your interest.\n\nIs your statement meant to be positive or normative?\n<RE>: A fair point, something I was thinking while writing the post.  My statement is MEANT to be positive, but as a selfish individual I would still favor policies that will tend to benefit me.  Thus, I would vote for a candidate who will favor those living within the bounds of my country over those not living within the bounds of my country.  Would I also favor a policy generally beneficial to white people to the exclusion of all other racial groups?  Though it would seem consistent I'd have more reservations about something like that, for a few reasons, ranging from the fact that I've been socialized to abhor racism, to the fact that people of diverse ethnic backgrounds already live all around me, and would probably be angry and resentful when faced with a policy like that which might actually make my life worse and more difficult (while people living in other countries by definition live far away and can be ignored more safely)\n\nI'm not mentioning fairness or anything, because I agree that national self-interest is a bit unfair, only slightly moderated by the fact that everyone is doing it.\nB: I agree it's difficult to defend, but does that matter?  It's selfishness that's stable enough to keep trucking along.  The philosophical justifications for anti-immigration policies are irrelevant if they exist, what matters is that the policies seem to 'work'\n<RE>: Countries are geographic regions based on largely arbitrary boundaries, mostly based on 19th-century politics, military conflicts and colonization.\n\nThe idea that countries are some kind of voluntary associations, like a rotary club, is ridiculous. National boundaries exist for all kinds of reasons, only a few of which involve voluntary economic transactions.\nA:  The US explicitly bars these people from doing this.\n\nHow many Burmese actually arrive here via plane or ship? If they can support each other or integrate into society, what do we have to worry about? \n\nMost immigrants are like Jose Vargas, the award-winning Filipino-American reporter who faces deportation despite holding a job his entire adult life. People who can finance a plane ticket from the 3rd world to the 1st typically have something to offer.\n<RE>: \"How many Burmese actually arrive here via plane or ship?\" \nBurmese citizens can enter essentially no country without a visa so taking a plane is out of the question. It's a long ride by boat.\n\nMany Burmese try to illegally enter Thailand and are deported from there.\nC: I believe people have a right to join other people who share their same values in order to live with each other, for example, gated communities have people who respect a certain building code and certain rules. A government is a large scale version of this, and I don't believe that racist communities should be any different.\n<RE>: For the most part, it prevents them from working in the US, denies them the right to vote in the US and deports those that do come. Those deported are sent back to an area where they have lower quality health care, schools, employment opportunities, et cetera. We have segregation in that we force one group to live in a completely different country.\n\nSo you're saying non citizens should be entitled to the right to vote and to the same quality of health care, etc. as citizens?\nC: See my other response to you.  Basically I'd argue that while both may well be equivalent ethically, practically speaking one makes sense, and the other is stupid.\n<RE>: Slavery was extremely practical and made sense for slave owners. I don't think practicality is a sufficient moral justification.\nA: How? \n\nPersonally, I'd like to see multi member districts and truly proportional voting?"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Here's what I'd do.

Don’t they have primaries and such?\n<RE>: Pretty sure the GOP will usually throw their support behind a candidate they prefer. It's not easy to get rid of an incumbent like that\nB: not sure honestly.  i mean if he’s as unpopular as he sounds...\n<RE>: I am sure.  It's not common.  It's not impossible for a party not to give the nomination to an incumbent, but it'd be highly irregular, and I'd imagine the Republican party as a whole would avoid doing so at most any cost.  It would be admitting failure at a high level, and short of some incredible scandal, I'd be surprised if it ever happens, especially given the new levels of tolerance Republicans seem to have for scandals.\nC: It's really, really not. It's generally viewed by the party as being too damaging to the incumbent, so unless there's real, concrete proof that the incumbent is dramatically less likely to win the general than the challenger (to the point that it overwhelms the advantage incumbents almost always have in the general), the party will do quite a lot to prevent it. Usually, even when the incumbent is genuinely toxic, the party will push for the incumbent to drop out, rather than contest the primary."}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Considering parties are political organizations and not just labels it's not common or expected."}]}]}
