Based entirely on the NPR article any CIA ""cover"" provided by the vaccine program was opportunistic at best- the program was in no way launched in order for the CIA to look for Bin Laden- they simply exploited it. The vaccine program was legit and the CIA would use any means necessary to find Bin Laden.

"C:  ""an official pardon for people who have been convicted of political offenses""

 You don’t think giving work permits to people who enter the country illegally, unilaterally without congressional approval, is amnesty?

Not by the definition you gave, which doesn't even remotely fit. Undocumented immigrants often haven't been convicted of anything, their offense is not a political one - it's a civil, not criminal, misdemeanour - and a restricted work permit is not a pardon.

",We’re saying they won’t be prosecuted for their crimes. It’s forgiveness for a crime they’ve committed.,1824,59,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics
