It is absolutely understood that the middle and poor class recycle their money at a higher rate than the rich. This is why the economy boomed during the great compression. Guy, just look back at our history. We don't have to speculate about this.

"B: As someone who is lives and uses the Singapore system, I would have to say that the price differentiation among the public and private hospitals mainly revolves around things not related to the actual health care.

For instance, you might have a private hospital room with catered cuisine, in-room espresso maker and attached suite for your husband (all with décor that resembles a fancy hotel.)

Or you might opt to share your room with someone else during recovery  in a simple room that looks more like what you would have in the US.

But the health care quality level is essentially the same.

Further, people tend to straddle both systems.  For some things (say a baby birth) you might go to the fancy hospital but for getting a mole removed you might go to the public clinic.  It allows for economic choice.

Furthermore, their prices have to reflect the reality of competition with the public system even in the private one.  

As an anecdotal example, I went to the fanciest hospital in town (the one that people fly in to from the rich oil states) and had a scan of my head done.  The total bill for the scan was $180 us, essentially what I would have paid for in the public system.  The ENT doctor specialist visit (top of his field) cost me ~$280 where a similar visit at the university hospital would cost me $200.  I attribute most of that difference to the mahogany in the waiting room.  

Also, for you people in the US, our cost of living is generally higher, so those prices are fairly affordable for even the lower incomes.  Plus, we put 20% of our paychecks into a sovereign fund that we can use to pay for medical expenses (or education, rent, retirement) so we usually have some cash on hand.","What about people who don't work?

He also doesn't point out that the mandatory contribution rate is lower, significantly so, then what we currently spend on insurance in the US. Using current cost basis we would achieve savings immediately even before utility and medical professionals income adjusts for the new system, this would be surfaced as lower public spending and a wage bump (as employers no longer cover insurance).

Also while the Medisave system did not contain costs, cost growth is still lower then elsewhere in the world by a fairly large margin. Its also worth pointing out that no one has figured out how to effectively contain costs anywhere, the cost of healthcare delivery rises as technology advances and short of refusing to make use of new treatment options there is no way to effectively contain costs.

Its not mandated but the way changing compensation costs impact wages is very well understood.

Suppose tomorrow employer insurance costs were zeroed then medium term (between a year and 5 years depending on the level of labor churn) wages would reflect the reduced total cost of compensation (effectively a $1 reduction in non-wage compensation cost would be reflected by a $1 increase in wages).

In the same situation suppose employer insurance costs were zeroed tomorrow but we also instituted a 8% HSA withholding then wages would immediately be raised by employers to cover this 8% while they retain the additional saving of ~$3k per employee with transfer to wages occurring over the medium term again.

Wage growth over the long term would also be much improved. Employers do not treat wages discretely from compensation, the rise in compensation is driven by the labor market and wages are raised after all other compensation costs are taken in to account. Currently retirement costs and healthcare costs (retirement is actually growing faster then healthcare) eat nearly all the increase in compensation growth which is why wage growth is managing a measly 4.8% over inflation a decade, this would be around 8% a decade (somewhere between 7.8% and 8.4%) without healthcare costs.",4591,165,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

A subsidy is designed to overcome an inefficiency in a market, it is intended to spur a particular type of activity (usually because its beneficial, that's the idea anyway).  The US isn't subsidising pharma, its just paying over the odds for medicine.  It spends a lot on R&amp;D but so do lots of other countries, advances don't just come from the US (not by a long shot), but R&amp;D in the US is very expensive...  I don't see what's hard to understand here.  The US isn't spending money that, if it weren't spent would mean that Europeans and Canadians wouldn't have access to medicines, or would pay more.. its not a subsidy.

&gt;I think you're missing something obvious here.

Yeah, that if a Canadian hospital buys a machine from a US company, or a German one or anyone else, and an American hospital does the same, the American patient will be charged more for accessing it.  The point here is that people in the US who have to spend more for the same care.

&gt;A system that the rest of the world fully takes advantage of.

No, if I go and buy the most expensively overpriced beef on the market, I am not subsidising your cheap hamburgers, the US spending vastly more on care does not mean its is subsidising anyone.. That said, there should be more R&amp;D investment globally, and care in the US shoul dbe cheaper, but again, that isn't the same thing by half.

&gt;Why don't you create an efficient and inexpensive way to develop medicine and cutting edge technology? Why rely on the US for all that??

Europe and Canada do develop medicines and cutting edge technology, they also sell it to the US, Universities around the world develop new ideas and concepts and they are handed to or bought by US pharma too..

"C: &gt; Sorry but this entire paragraph is a joke. You're attempting to narrow the definition of subsidy because of what? You can't handle the truth that Americans, through their taxes, higher health care costs and the overall health care industry that produces cheap medicine and technology that you don't have to really pay for, are subsidizing you?

No, I'm suggesting that paying abnormally high prices unnecessarily isn't a subsidy of anyone else.  If the US took measures to reduce prices, the amount spent on R&amp;D in the US and the cost of drugs outside of the US wouldn't go up.  However, if you want to broaden the term subsidy to mean that anyone with a higher end-user cost is subsidising those with a lower end user cost then fine, but it becomes pretty meaningless.

Some function of income. Ideally non-political, an equivalent of the SSA with the power to adjust rates would be ideal.

&gt; Is there the potential for problems like our mandatory contribution to retirement accounts?

What mandatory contribution to retirement accounts?

&gt; Could it go underfunded just like Social Security (whether or not SS actually faces a crisis is immaterial to the question I'm asking)?

SS is facing a large crisis but no, as this is an individual account it is not subject to the same problem as a national account.

&gt; Potential for mismanagement in the new public provider department?

Public providers are effectively hands off. Think of these like charter organizations, they have their objective (delivery healthcare with a small profit margin) set publicly but that's the extent of the public involvement (other then usual monitoring &amp; oversight you would expect to prevent fraud etc).

&gt; You said the hospitals will be slightly profitable- what happens when they aren't?

They are required to remain profitable, if they find themselves loosing money then they raise prices. The point of having these around is precisely so we have knowledge of what local prices for healthcare are without incurring a loss to the provider.

In the case where there is no way to make the facility profitable (dying city etc) then it would be closed but with consultation with the state government, there will absolutely be cases where state governments (particularly in states like Alaska) choose to operate facilities themselves that run at a loss to serve communities that otherwise would not have access to healthcare.

&gt; You mention that prices are well advertised to consumers at public hospitals- is the same true at private hospitals before someone swipes the HSA card?

Yes. A requirement for accepting HSA payments would be clear pricing that's available on demand.

"B: &gt;I see health care as a human right, thus falls under the umbrella of what government should provide.

This is why I find a libertarianism irritating as a philosophy, honestly. When presented with a situation like health care where markets obviously fail and lack of government involvement produces bad results (i.e. people dying of preventable diseases or reduced to penury through bad luck) they find themselves unable to endorse practical, tested solutions without first having a convoluted argument about ""rights.""

If there's a ""human right"" to healthcare, where do you draw the line? Should 95 year olds be entitled to free open-heart surgery? Should we pay for a potentially lifesaving treatment that has a 1% chance of working? What if that treatment costs a billion dollars. At what point do practical considerations have to step up and trample on someone's rights?

Maybe instead of framing every issue as whether the government has the ""right"" to do something or not, we should instead look at issues as problems and try to evaluate the effective solutions. Sometimes the best solutions will be market solutions, sometimes they'll involve a heavy-handed government (our solution to murder is and has been to give the government the ""right"" to imprison and, in some cases, kill citizens) but the solution should be determined by what actually works rather than some abstract political philosophy. 

This cuts both ways. Once you have this sort of ""limitations of government"" frame as the key criterion, it's not especially difficult to argue either side of an issue for or against government or human rights. Once you're arguing for universal health care somehow being acceptable in a libertarian framework, what *can't* fit? Pretty much any issue in American politics has multiple rights and interests on both sides, which is why those who favor severe government restrictions on abortion couch it as ""right to life.""

I guess it's a nice idea in theory, but the experience across the world is that more government involvement usually produces better results and always produces cheaper results.

It's easy to see why the insurance industry pushes so hard for this, since it would allow them to pursue a ""race to the bottom"" and locate all insurance plans in the states with the loosest/friendliest regulations similar to the credit card industry. For what its worth, I think it's not a huge problem every credit card company operates out of Delaware or South Dakota, but there are actual regulations that matter in the insurance market (ones that prevent you from being dropped from your insurance when you get sick, for example) so a ""race to the bottom"" would be very problematic.

There has never been a proper market for healthcare. The doctor only profits when we are sick or injured. A good market would pay the doctor when we are healthy and cost the doctor when we are sick or injured. 

We currently pay a subscription fee for medical care when we are healthy. The insurance companies pay doctors and hospitals a portion of that subscription fee when we are sick. US citizens pay private insurance companies 2.5 trillion dollars a year for access to doctors and hospitals. What all medical professionals earn each year is less than the 2.5 trillion dollars that we pay.  The insurance companies keep more of our money when we are healthy. The medical professionals only make money by charging the most they possibly can for visits and procedures. The incentives are all wrong and this is why medical costs are so high. We should pay doctors and hospitals a subscription fee when we are healthy in exchange for a commitment from doctors and hospitals to take care of every healthcare need. In other words, we should stop giving 2.5 trillion a year to insurance companies and give that money directly to the people that give us care. Doctors are hopefully smart people. They do not need a corporate gatekeeper with a Masters degree in business to dole out money to them. 
 
Here is how it would work. You pay your primary doctor each month who then contracts with a range of specialists and a hospital or two in your area. Your market choice becomes any primary care practice in your area. Your doctor is a part of a national reciprocation network that covers you when you travel and part of the money you pay your doctor goes into a national catastrophic fund for those rare illnesses that require travel and extended care. Prices would come down through competition. The hundreds of millions taken out in insurance company operations and profit could go to lower the price. Hospitals would be fully funded without having to admit a single patient so charging $80 for a box of tissues would end. Doctors would earn more money than investment bankers so the Doctors shortage would be over in a few years. The primary care doctor would be the center of the medical universe and he is already paid before you get sick so no unnecessary procedures or follow up visits. There would many alternatives like webcam diagnosis and phone call follow-ups that would be great for patients. How much illness is spread because Doctors cannot be paid unless sick people all gather and wait in the same room?
 
If we combine this change with strong malpractice tort reform then doctors will be able to reach out and be much more charitable. They will already be paid well so if we can limit the risk of giving care then doctors who are inclined to do so can give reduced rates or even free care for those who cannot afford their regular rates. In the US, the crux of the problem is charging by the visit or by the procedure. It is the wrong incentive. Doctors are paid more when the patient is sick. If you pay the doctor when you are healthy like you do the health insurance companies then the financial incentive to the doctor is to have you healthy and at home and not visiting or having a procedure.
 
A single person pays an average of $6,000 (including employer contributions) dollars a year for health care coverage. If that person is healthy he will see the doctor an average of three visits per year. Assume the average visit pays the doctor's practice $300. That is $900 dollars out of $6000 that goes to the doctor. Now suppose the entire $6,000 goes to the doctor. He uses half of that money to contract with a range of specialists practices and a hospital so that all of your local health needs are met. He also uses a bit of that half to add you to a reciprocation network so that you are fully covered when you travel. He also contributes a bit into a national catastrophic care fund that handles rare expensive cases that involve traveling to a specialist and experimental treatments etc. The doctor's practice now has $3000 guaranteed dollars from you instead of a speculative $900. That is more than three times what the doctor could eek out charging by visit. Everything but consumables is paid for. All salaries, the building, all the testing equipment is all paid in full before you arrive. The doctor is competing with the dozens of other practices in your community. The specialists and the hospitals are competing to be in the doctors networks. There is a lot of room for lower prices in this model. There is no compulsion to go back to the petrie dish waiting room for a follow up. much more cost effective for the doctor to call or skype. Internet medicine would no longer be stifled by insurance company or government rules. The internist or GP doctor would be the center of the medical universe as it should be.

Notice that this solution does not mention government. This plan would only require a consensus of courageous doctors to implement. The national average payout for medicare is more than $6000 a year. Government could pay the primary doctor on your behalf but the relationship and decisions would be between you and the doctor only.

From an 'engineering' view point, the better way is to experiment it in small scale at first, then fixing the 'bugs' or withdraw the whole thing when the cost is still affordable.

So much money is wasted in HMO overhead and crazy pricing structures and haggling.  I read that doctors spend a considerable amount of time haggling with HMO's.  What makes the Canadian system great is not so much single payer model, but the efficiencies from it which cascade down, and other benefits from efficiencies else where.

I'll explain.  A doctor can graduate medical school with significantly less debt because of heavily subsidized education.  He can practice or work in a practice with minimal administrative staff, bill more working hours, and get immediate cash flow, all because of no HMO bureaucracy.  Similarly, other services like testing, diagnostics, etc. benefit from the same efficiencies.  As well, data can be mined from the central system to predict larger scale cost savings from vaccines, heart disease education, etc.  Access to the system is controlled via a Health Card.  Basically, like a drivers licence.  I go for an x-ray, I hand it to them, they swipe it, that is it, no paperwork.

"B: While true, that doesn't really get at the heart of my objection -- that the proximity of the US and Canada doesn't necessarily make them analogous for the purposes of healthcare (although you note quite correctly that the US's population density is not likely to be an insurmountable trouble, as Canada has done better with worse). 

Note that I'm not saying that single-payer would be bad. I think it would be an improvement over what we have now. But I'm also not convinced it would be the best option. Perhaps more importantly, I'm worried that building enthusiasm for single-payer based on unrealistic expectations of cost savings is harmful. I think it'll be harmful when the CBO comes out and says ""The Bernie Sanders crowd is wrong; this is going to cost a fuckton"" and that it'll be harmful five years after single-payer is passed, when fiscal conservatism is back in fashion and the Right can't stop talking about how we're paying 30% more than we expected to for healthcare.

Social ownership may refer to forms of **public, collective, or cooperative ownership, or to citizen ownership of equity**.  
There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them.  
Social ownership is the common element shared by its various forms.

[Dictionary definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socialism)  
&gt; any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods

There is nothing inherently ""evil"" about socialism. The description is so broad that it covers many aspects of your life that you don't even consider.

And what do you want me to source exactly? Do you want a single number which summarises NHS vs private healthcare. Such a thing doesn't and cannot exist. As I explained the situation is very complex because it's not a ""one or another"" scenario, you don't decide between getting NHS or private insurance. Everyone goes to the NHS for their healthcare needs, and if you want some supplemental treatment you can get some private perks on an ad hoc basis. E.g. if you want to get an MRI faster or get another doctor to look over your results you can get it done privately. If you need cosmetic treatments you get them done privately. If the doctor sees you privately, it is literally going to be the same doctor treating you probably in the same hospital according to the exact same national guidelines, but they are likely to be nicer to you and give you a few extra minutes of their time since they are getting a little bonus out of it. The private options are only there to supplement your NHS treatment, not to replace it. ","It's basically the exact same approach in Canada.

Canadians are pretty resistant to opening up healthcare to too much privatization primarily because we have the American model right across the border constantly reminding us of what that could look like.

Canadians largely also don't want a two tiered system where the wealthy get amazing health care and public options repeatedly get slashed budgets to the point where it can barely be called healthcare.

"B: I'm in the UK. Nominally we have private insurance but I think it's disingenuous to call it insurance policies as the term is understood around the world. Very few people use them, and they must exist within the context of the national health service. This is because practically all the hospitals, training, machines and resources except a very small handful for super rich clientele (mostly in London) are owned by the state. 

I work as a doctor in a hospital. Even if you have private insurance you will generally get treated in a government hospital by a government employee. The relationship between the private companies and the NHS is very complex to put into a comment box and it varies wildly by region and hospital. 

What's the point of it? Well it's up for huge debate. The doctor will treat you much better and work you up for longer since they are skimming a nice bonus off it and even totally unfounded patient complaints will make a big difference. You'll get a non urgent MRI in a week instead of 3 months... But the actual nitty gritty, it's really debatable whether you actually have any long term improvements in healthcare by having a private insurance policy or not. Probably the only real difference is that doctors and nurses will be nicer to you. 

The private options in the UK are just to supplement your healthcare really. Unless you're a super multi millionaire, you will still be getting most of your treatment in an NHS hospital.","Not quite.

I say *additional* because that's on top of what we already spend. However, I also say additional because it means that the federal government would have to spend the money, and it would have to get the money from somewhere.

Where would the money come from? Taxpayers, of course. Instead of paying premiums to insurance companies, they'd pay extra taxes. So they'd save money on premiums and pay more in taxes, which would likely lead to a more progressive (i.e. higher taxes on the wealthy than the poor) tax system and a more equal after-tax income level (i.e. after taxes, the poor would get a boost, while the wealthy would take a hit).

They and the Urban Institute put out this report estimating the cost. They estimate that the additional federal expenditures on healthcare to fund single-payer would be $32 trillion.

As of 2015, [the US spent $3.2T on healthcare](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/highlights.pdf). That is TOTAL expenditures, not just government expenditures. At that amount, we already had the highest per-capita healthcare cost [by a substantial margin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita)

[Edit: The study predicts an increase of $2.5T in 2017, so it would be $4.4T or $13707 person]

I didn't read the study you cited in detail, but a quick read of it suggest that they are assuming costs billed for a given procedure will remain stable, but that we will be increasing coverage and adding millions more people to the healthcare rolls. That is a naive interpretation. There are MANY ways that single payer can save money-- simply getting rid of the ban on medicaid negotiating drug prices would greatly lower the costs.

It is certainly possible, even probable, that single payer would result in a short-term spike in costs as we begin treating people who were previously uninsured, but I don't see any rational argument that the long term costs will continue at that rate.

It's not ludicrous at all. Many of the uninsured sick would be placed on single-payer, have to be paid for, and the healthy young who would be placed on would pay less into the system since they make less money. Plus, when you add coverage to people, and they're no longer relying on coverage from silver plans alone, costs go up. And people use healthcare more when they have insurance.

No, it wouldn't greatly lower costs at all. The CBO said back in [2004 that](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/108th-congress-2003-2004/reports/fristletter.pdf) this would have a ""negligible effect"" on spending, and that's for Medicare, which is even larger than Medicaid as a program. If Medicare Part D got the same prices as Medicaid and the VA, it would save [only $15 billion or so per year](https://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2015/07/23/u-s-could-save-up-to-16b-if-medicare-part-d-negotiated-prices-paper/).

That's virtually nothing, with the costs we're talking about. By the way, Medicaid doesn't negotiate drug prices, it [literally has price controls already](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/us/16drug.html).

Something tells me you should read the whole study.

&gt;It is certainly possible, even probable, that single payer would result in a short-term spike in costs as we begin treating people who were previously uninsured, but I don't see any rational argument that the long term costs will continue at that rate. There are simply too many opportunities for cost savings.

Because insuring the 10% of the population that remains uninsured will lead to cost increases. So will the increase in usage of medical services that are available when you have single-payer, and so will spending on long-term services and supports, if that is included as Sanders proposed.","Reading the study further, they say the cost increase in 2017 would be $2.5T. That means the total would be about $4.4T if I have all the numbers right. That is an increase of about 37.5% over the total expenditures (OOP, Premiums and government expenditures) in 2015. Given that we already know costs have increased since 2015, I don't think estimating a 30% increase is unreasonable.

So yes, I would agree that is not completely ludicrous, though it still seems a bit high to me. 

However, in exchange for that increase, we get a healthier populace. A healthier populace means higher productivity, and reduced lost-work costs to employers. Medical bankruptcies would be eliminated, and hospitals writing off bad debt would be eliminated. 

Given these external factors, it's hard to estimate the actual effect on the %GDP cost, but it's clear that the actual effect on the economy would be a lot less than a simple reading of ""It will cost $32T!!!"" suggests. 


&gt; It's not ludicrous at all. Many of the uninsured sick would be placed on single-payer, have to be paid for, and the healthy young who would be placed on would pay less into the system since they make less money.

Only about 13.4% of Americans are currently uninsured, so I can't see it increasing that much.

&gt; and the healthy young who would be placed on would pay less into the system since they make less money. Plus, when you add coverage to people, and they're no longer relying on coverage from silver plans alone, costs go up. And people use healthcare more when they have insurance.


These all would result in a SHIFT in the expenses, from for-profit insurance companies and out-of-pocket expenses. They would not result in HIGHER expenses. That said, it is possible that single payer would result in higher utilization, even compared to insured people, so some increase is probably reasonable.

This means that the way the claim is presented is highly misleading for several reasons

- This is not the cost of single payer, it is the cost of **one specific bill**. This means the estimate doesn't speak for single payer in general. The [report](http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/2000785-The-Sanders-Single-Payer-Health-Care-Plan.pdf) only calls it ""The Sanders Single Payer Healthcare Plan"" but it didn't originate with Sanders as the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/more-democrats-embrace-universal-coverage--and-the-gop-goes-on-the-attack/2017/07/06/62fb8f78-5ddf-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html) notes that it refers to the [Conyers bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676/cosponsors). [This comparison](http://www.medicareforall.org/pages/HR676_and_S915) notes that the Sanders plan was to create 50 state insurance plans. The Sanders bill can be found [here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/915/text), see section 2, point (d). For the record I thought this was a pretty bad plan.

- The claim isn't that the cost would be 32 trillion, it claims that spending would **increase** by that amount. This number is also derived by only looking at the **federal government** and does not take into account people who chose to buy private health insurance or have their employers pay contribution, or government at the non-federal level. To put some numbers to it, the report states that state and local governments would save 4.1 trillion dollars and private groups would save 21.9 trillion dollars (page 3). That means **the plan costs *6 trillion dollars* more than the current system**. The report also notes that the plan is insufficiently funded and **the government would need to raise *16.6 trillion dollars* in additional revenue**.

Stanley O'Neal from Merrill Lynch and Co got $161,500,000 on his way out after that mess he pulled there. Something seems very wrong about that.

","Sure, I can link you to some of the books used in university-level courses on corruption, an aspect of the abuse of power. Nearly all studies of this subject in the political science academia show a correlation that higher salary is correlated with less corruption. 

But inferring that this means increasing salary would automatically kill corruption is entirely not understanding how political science and economics work. Abuse of power occurs in situations that have countless factors allowing them to thrive: lack of oversight, lack of accountability, disenfranchised citizens, lack of competition, societal standards, moral values, lack of coverage, government infrastructure, and government negligence just to name a few. For unique situations, maybe one factor could be the tipping point, but for most abuse of power cases it is a combination of such factors or lack thereof. Limiting the presences of these factors would lead to a decline of likelihood of abuse of power. High salary itself is not enough to rid government of corruption.

There is a difference between paying private company executives higher salary than paying public officials because public officials have more public scrutiny and accountability expectation than business leaders, at least in democratic states. Also, public officials and business leaders have different responsibilities and interests.

"B: I will look into those titles, thanks.","The underlying assumption of your question is that it's the job of elected officials to manage the state of the economy. I understand that, in today's political climate, this seems like a given, but it's not.

In the US, the Constitution is the prevailing document of law. Its stated purpose is ""to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity"". That says nothing about managing the economy, and traditionally, the US practiced something closer to [Laissez-faire capitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire#United_States) than we have now.

The shift occurred because political analysts realized that the people would often vote in their economic best interests, so it was easier to get elected if you could demonstrate policies that would broadly strenthen the economy. Ronald Reagan famously ran by asking voters, ""Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"" James Carville opined as Bill Clinton's campaign strategy, ""It's the economy, stupid!""

As for pros and cons, I think the pros are obvious. But if we incentivize economic performance, what happens when the economic benefit of a policy stands in conflict with officials' other duties? For instance, abolition of slavery was disastrous to the South, and the resulting Civil War nearly bankrupted the entire nation. Does that mean elected officials would have been right to support slavery? Generally speaking, war brings about strong economic performance. Does that mean we should incentivize elected officials to keep us in a state of constant war? There are so many policies that are right, just, and of widespread benefit to the populace that don't result in direct improvement to the economy (especially within the average elected official's term). It would be counter to the goals of governance to place the state of the economy above all those other policies by implementing incentives.",11859,41,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

The only way for the common man to develop the same kind of personal connections is through years of service in public office.


Congressmen get paid well and receive lots of perks, so it's not surprising that all of them seem rich, but in reality, the vast majority of politicians hold local district seats that do not pay very well for the work involved.  


Also, I find it hard to fault these career politicians for taking lobbying jobs once they are out of office.  Most of them still have families to support and what other employment opportunities are available after spending 10+ years in public office?

All of the calls for a select committee that I've seen involve 6 from each party, hopefully preventing party politics from taking over. I'm not sure what would happen in the event of a deadlock.

Edit: 10 to 9, not 8 to 7, including the ex officio members. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence","None of the responses addressed your core question so let me take a stab at it:

First, the investigation/s of Russia and their possible state-sponsored interference of the US election. It's worth noting for the past 50ish years most countries keep a respectful distance from one another during their democratic processes. They tend to shy away from picking one candidate over another and make generic statements such as ""looking forward to our continued partnership"".  In the case of Russia  there is a growing concern that Russia is actively engaged in attempting to tilt/shift elections in multiple countries in ways that are advantageous to their interests, either by electing people who are pro Russia or people who will execute policies that are beneficial to Russia. In the case of the US there appears to be evidence and consensus among the US intelligence community that the Russians obtained information about politicians in the US and selectively released it to their advantage. On one end of the scale you have the Russians who say they were not involved, that the US only has its self to blame for its problems. On the other you have a chorus of people claiming the Russians ""stole"" the election and thwarted the entire democratic process. In the middle you have people who claim the Russians had a goal of weakening/discrediting a future president Clinton and just got really lucky with their efforts.

Second, Trump. That's a loaded one so I'm going to tried carefully. Trumps investigations, if any, break down into 3 main groups:

1. Possible collusion between his campaign and the Russians during the election. There is ample speculative evidence due to many of his key staffers having direct or indirect ties to Russia but beyond that nothing public has come for light that has triggered a criminal investigation (that we know of). Plenty of investigations and conducted in secret and/or concluded with nothing substantive found. 

2. Trumps personal business dealings. Trump and his many companies have relationships around the globe. There are concerns about them beyond Russia, but given the alleged Russian involvement I mentioned earlier many have made accusations that trump, his family, or his business ventures could directly benefit from his presidency. The accusers cite Trumps unwillingness to release his tax returns and other information as proof of some form of guilt, whereas his supporters note he has complied to disclose where required by law.

3. Blackmail. There have been wild and salacious accusations directed at Trump and others in his staff, that the Russians have obtained deeply embarrassing or illegal material and are being blackmailed.

While some of the things I mentioned aren't explicitly illegal there's been a pervasive sense of ""truth in lending"" with our public officials. This is the first time in modern history that a President has asserted his right to still be a private citizen, which people who oppose him immediately tend to assume implies deceit.

Third, Michael Flynn. I won't touch on the financial accusations with Russia only to say there are some floating around. The big one is his potential violation of the Logan Act. Basically, it's illegal to conduct the business of the United States with foreign governments if you aren't elected to an official capacity in the government that requires you to perform those functions. In the case of Mr Flynn he may have gotten ahead of himself in his conversations with his Russian counterparts before he actually started working in his official capacity at the National Security Counsel. It's important to note that no one has ever been prosecuted for the Logan Act. That being said Mr Flynn did resign from his position, so he either did so to avoid distracting the new administration with a ""scandal"" or he wanted to avoid a formal investigation. Either way, it seems to have settled down for now.

The bottom line is you have a new administration who was not elected via popular vote. The opposition to the Trump administration is going to magnify any grain of information that comes out, and the press will run with it because it brings good ratings. Whether these things will actually bring some form of an investigation remains to be seen.

And how realistic is it that we could possibly have such a confluence of events exist?","Re: the constitutional violation, it may be worth noting that in some states certain funding categories are constitutionally guaranteed.  For example, in Arkansas, the state constitution was amended in the 1980s to fund schools in vaguely worded way, the gist of which was that the Legislature had to pay education accounts first before paying off other line items.  

Everyone kind of forgot about it until a few years later when a poor and underfunded school district called Lake View challenged their lack of funding on constitutional grounds, citing that amendment.  Lake View itself was represented on a contingency basis by some rather low-rent lawyers, but other school districts in the state saw the value of their argument and took the ball and ran with it.  By the early 2000s, Mike Huckabee (then governor, just as die-hard a Republican as Brownback) was forced by the Arkansas Supreme Court to appoint a Blue Ribbon Commission to oversee school funding, and the Legislature was court-ordered to fund the schools as recommended by that Commission.  As a result Arkansas's composite ranking across categories like teacher pay and test performance jumped from basically 49th in every category (""Thank God for Mississippi"") to close to the national average.  It was expensive but the results were popular, and, after all, it reflected the will of the voters.

The point I think is this: voters are always all for taxes being cut and other people's benefits being reduced, but no one really wants to take it in the teeth themselves.  Even in a super-red state like Arkansas or Kansas, they will also vote for broad-brush ideas like ""education gets funded first"" without real regard for conservative principles or really any economic theory at all.  

One of the interesting things about Republican hegemony of the national apparatus under Trump is it becomes a proving ground for all the big talk the party has issued on bloated government and tax-and-spend policies going back to Grover Norquist and the [""Starve the Beast""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast) theory starting in the 1970s.  It will be interesting to see if these Brownbackian policies can even get off the ground to be tested on a national level.  So far, the GOP has been unable to actually pass the bills necessary to ""run the experiment,"" for example by returning healthcare to pre-Obamacare footing.  The sticking point is coverage for pre-existing conditions, which, again, is not a benefit even conservative-minded voters really seem to want to give up, when it affects their own personal pocketbooks.

"A: The interesting thing about the single-payer argument is that in a lot of ways we already have universal insurance, and we've had it for years.

Reagan signed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act in 1986.  That law made it illegal for any hospital which takes Medicare funds to turn away any individual who needs emergency treatment regardless of ability to pay or national origin.

I practice law in the Atlanta area.  We see ""self-pay"" (which means ""no pay"") plaintiffs every single day.  Someone without insurance gets in a car wreck, goes to the hospital, gets treated.  The hospital sends a bill.  They do not pay the bill.  The bill goes to collections.  They cannot pay the bill collector either.  Eventually the bill gets written off as bad debt by the hospital, which gets a tax deduction but otherwise gets screwed.  Except this is so normal, the hospital simply makes up its billing deficits by over-charging other customers and their insurers for routine procedures.  This is how a simple MRI gets to be $4,000 instead of the $800 it costs at a standalone facility.  Insurers, in turn, push back by refusing to pay above a certain percentage (Medicare/Medicaid does the same thing).  A classic arms race ensues, with insurers negotiating lower and lower percentage payments, charged-amounts ever increasing, and those with the ability to pay ultimately funding those who cannot.

In other words, we *have had universal health care for years.*  Push this structure out to the extreme and you get what are localled called ""the Gradies"" - indigents who cannot afford care but who know that if they walk into the emergency room at Grady Hospital in downtown Atlanta, they will be seen and given some form of basic treatment.  The Gradies treat the Grady E/R as their primary care clinic.  Because Grady is in a rough part of town and treats an extremely high proportion of indigents, there aren't enough people paying full freight to float their debts.  Thus Grady goes into crisis mode once a decade or so and has to be bailed out.

See, e.g., http://www.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/state-could-offer-bailouts-safety-net-hospitals/RYUAFX3WgjsaEtKPh6daAN/

http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2003/06/23/daily29.html

What this all means is, we have an unregulated and *inefficient* market for public healthcare right now.  All the normal market forces are already at work, with those who can pay footing the bill for basic care for those who cannot pay (the same end result of universal single-payer healthcare), but there is a Byzantine web of middlemen, insurance billing specialists, coders who input billing codes just the right way, lawyers, public and private investors all mixed up in the system.  I have a friend who makes a rich six figure salary just consulting with hospitals on how to increase their recovery percentages (kind of like search engine optimization just for hospital billing).

There are lots of objections to universal health care as it has been proposed, but the one thing I never heard in the entire Obamacare debate was a basic statement of how the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 impacts the existence of a world full of ""Gradies.""  A single payer system may not be ideal but it would at least push all this out into the light.

Tl;dr: We already have universal health care because Reagan said the hospitals can't turn people away to die in the streets.  This is a big reason why health care is so expensive, and the market is horribly inefficient as a result.",Universal healthcare means more than treatment in emergency situations for judgement proof individuals. Those that have some assets can't duck the collections agencies and have their credit ruined and have to declare bankruptcy. Most preventative care and non-emergency situations still remained out of reach for the poor and homeless. That is not universal healthcare.,12763,15,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

The rules only require the hospital to stabilize and treat immediate problems.  If you break your leg, they have to set the bone but they don't have to provide physical therapy.  If you have a heart attack, they have to try to keep you from dying but they'll kick you out as soon as you're stable (along with a prescription for statins and blood thinners that they know damn well you can't afford).  If you show up in labor they'll deliver the baby, but if you show up a month early for prenatal care they'll tell you to pound sand.  This level of treatment is objectively unequal to the level of treatment that a wealthy/insured patient would receive.  It is far below the level of treatment that people in some developing countries receive. Hell, you know our system is broken when you're better off being poor and sick in Andorra or Colombia than in the US.

"B: I'd like to add to this that we in the US already pay more than [2x per capita for our healthcare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) compared to universal care countries like Canada or the UK. For all that spending, though, we aren't receiving a noticeably better level of treatment than those countries: we actually rank [12th out of the 12 wealthiest industrialized nations](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/04/20/524774195/what-country-spends-the-most-and-least-on-health-care-per-person) in terms of health outcomes. It's worth noting, too, that not only do we spend more per capita than any other country, but that we spend more *public* money per capita than all but two of the countries *with a publicly funded universal care system* ([source here](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective)):

&gt;Even though the U.S. is the only country without a publicly financed universal health system, it still spends more public dollars on health care than all but two of the other countries.

So we're spending more money, both privately and publicly, for far fewer people covered and no noticeable medical benefits. I would think that anyone looking at these numbers would agree that the US could benefit greatly from a single-payer system, but for so many of us, it seems those are three dirty words.  ","You know, they say the US spends 2x more per capita on health care, but what does that actually mean? Are salaries to those in the biotech sector counted as in that amount? Is it the expenses of medicare + expenses of insurance companies added together? How much of the expenses of medical technology exported to the world is counted in the ""spent on healthcare"" ?",12763,28,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

Of that amount, $4,197 is public money, meaning that - in public dollars alone - we spend

&gt;more than in any other country except Norway ($4,981) and the Netherlands ($4,495), despite the fact that the U.S. was the only country studied that did not have a universal health care system

This is a big reason why health care is so expensive, and the market is horribly inefficient as a result.

Please explain to me how hospitals are obligated to treat someone with a condition that is not immediately life threatening but will most certainly lead to their death...eventually. The answer is that they don't. Nothing you've said here addresses this issue, which is one of the MAIN ISSUES Obamacare was addressing. What you've described is not universal healthcare, you are misdirecting from the actual issue.

Besides, you are talking about emergencies, which is much more varied than you are making it seem. For example, if someone doesn't have insurance and obviously can't pay the hospital may force them to wear a cast on their broken arm rather than go for a more expensive surgery that has the potential to heal faster and better. ",12763,44,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"B: See, that was definitely the intent of the Reagan-era law, but that is not how it has played out in practice.  The problem with emergent care is that you have to diagnose in order to determine whether the condition is an emergency or not.  And there is always a .01% chance of a misdiagnosis.  That creates the potential for exposure for *malpractice*, meaning the hospitals have to do more than the absolute bare minimum because they get sued if they decide a guy needs a cast and in fact he has a blood clot which results in his death.

As a result most of these indigent patients end up receiving what amounts to bare-bones clinic type care in the E/R, in order to shield the hospital from potential lawsuits.  Just because you can't pay doesn't mean a hospital is entitled to commit malpractice in treating you.  The hospitals have to give these people at least medically-reasonable care under the circumstances, payment or not.

You guys are having a hard time recognize when someone agrees with you.  I'm in favor of universal health care.  The fact that it is already partially being paid for in an inefficient way is an argument to do it right.","You aren't addressing what I'm referring to at all. You're saying that the intent of the law was that people who need long term care would get it, despite their inability to pay for it? I don't think that's true. 

In addition, I don't think that the reason the care is bare bones is only because they are shielding themselves from lawsuits, it's because they know they will have to foot the bill.

""Starving the beast"" is a political strategy employed by American conservatives to limit government spending by cutting taxes, in order to deprive the federal government of revenue in a deliberate effort to force it to reduce spending.
The term ""the beast"", in this context, refers to the United States Federal Government, which funds numerous programs and government agencies using mainly American taxpayer dollars. These programs include: education, welfare, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Defence.

There is also the enormous number of benefits that likely shouldn't be writeoffs but are. Use of a corporate jet?

Post-scarcity makes the assumption that the abundance of a certain set of resources will make **all** capitalism obsolete - and they then quibble over what those resources are, and at what level of abundance this will occur at. But the simple fact is that, in terms of basic human needs, we've been post-scarcity for decades, and capitalism is still going strong.

I tend to agree with the first video I linked that it's a bit like saying that the invention of the automobile and the advancement of technology will always create new and better jobs for horses no matter what.

Since the domestication of the horse almost four thousand years ago, less and less horses have been being used to do the same work they once did. However despite that the number of horses and the diversity of jobs meant for them was at an all time peak in the early 1900's after millenniums of technological advancement.

That is right up until they were almost completely replaced by the automobile, and the number of horses on earth and jobs for them plummeted to a tiny fraction of what it used to be.

The argument is that now that AI is almost totally replacing human brain power that we are like those horses right before the car.



&gt;Do you think farmers a few centuries ago imagined what an economy would look like that doesn't rely on 90% agriculture jobs?

They are not vastly cheaper because prices are determined by demand as well. Workers will have to compete with machines which will drive their wages down to machine level. This will reduce demand on products and lower their prices as well. You need to google comparative advantage.

To me this says ""you think SS works? Great. Do some real analysis on how to apply effectively, because clearly merely lowering taxes isn't giving the results you are expecting"". Until that is done, there is little reason to believe it will magically work in practice considering that doesn't appear to be  the case in real world experiments. ","&gt; GDP growth was lower under Bush2 than Clinton, 2.1% to 3.9%, respectively. Real GDP growth was also lower, 3.8% to 4.7%. Total jobs created were 2.1 million under Bush2 (though that's subtracting the 3.6 million lost in 2008), while under Clinton some 21.5 million jobs were created.

It gets really complicated to make such a claim because you're essentially ignoring state policies. This was also the era of governors like Weld and Johnson who were pushing fiscally conservative state policies alongside Clinton's policy. Overall, what was the makeup of state-level policies that was matched up to each presidential term? I don't know the answer to that question, but it really complicates the ability to attribute what happened under a federal administration as the result of the federal policy made.

That's in addition to asking how much we can separate it from private industry matters. Bill Clinton's presidency also essentially coincides with the rise of both the personal computer and the internet. If you follow the history of these things, it's clear that these pivotal moments were going to happen anyways and the companies that profited from it started their work in the time of Reagan and Bush1, but obviously they created an insane amount of wealth and many of today's richest people in the world. It was a very special time. It was a bubble. And that bubble burst near 2000 in a way that doesn't really make sense to attribute to the government. As a result of the bubble bursting (and the stabilization of the PC paradigm), it really was a big slow down in the industry until the next paradigm shift, when the Apple iPhone was released in June of '07 which created an entirely different and massive industry, the smartphone. I'm not saying that these completely explain the differences in economic performance that happens to sort of line up with presidential terms, but these massive economic events are an example of how tough it is to attribute GDP growth to simply the tax policy at the top. The sample size is WAY too small to claim much certainty.

At the same time, to what extent do we trace the actual money? The argument by Republicans is that when taxes are low on the wealthy, their money goes into investments. Investments aren't something that produces immediate responses. They are something that allows startups like Facebook, YouTube, Android (the company it came from), etc. to survive long enough to turn into large successful ventures. These are all giants today that were born in the climate of Bush2. I'm not saying that Bush2's policies made these companies, but that it's important to note that what was exploding under Obama and Clinton, was often born under Bush2 and Bush1. These things take years (perhaps, into another presidents term) to pay off. Taxes themselves are slow to go from the presidents desk to the actual IRS policy and, from there, even slower to start to drive any real economic change either way.

Supply Side policies attempt to address the shortfall through making capital more available to business. Whether that's through lowering the federal interest rate (cheaper borrowing), tax deduction (lowering operating costs or making expansion less expensive), government subsidies (direct or indirect), or other means.

Right now I'm struggling to think of any non-government market segments that have insufficient capacity to meet demand. I submit that nearly all commercial segments have _excess_ capacity relative to demand.

Based on your last sentence I believe you and I are basically in agreement however I'd say that what you're really talking about are _failed_ supply side economics (I'm referring to them as policies).

IMHO the reason Supply Side policies are failing is because the problem isn't with the supply of anything, it's with the _demand_.

Expressed very simply I believe that the root of the demand problem is that too large of a percentage of our population simply don't have enough disposable income.

Increasing supply does you no good if there's a lack of demand due to insufficient income. As a business owner the government (Federal, State, Local) can give me all the subsidies they want but if there's no one there to buy my product or service then I'm not going to invest my time, organizational energy, or money in it.

"C: Please note that questions of tax reduction on a state or local level government are different than the question of tax reduction at the federal level. This is because states are not currency creators. Every penny they spend, they must first tax. Money used for a public good reduces money that can be spent for a private good. There is certainly a balance that ought to be struck and that balance may be different in place and time.

The federal government has the power to create and circulate new currency through deficit spending. When the government deficit spends, it creates a private sector surplus. That's money flowing from the government to people and business. When the government has a budget surplus, it creates a private sector deficit, reducing (ceteris paribus) the money held by private persons and business.

Do note that the capital account surplus in the chart is dollars being repatriated (often in stocks or real estate) from overseas companies that sold products in the US (think trade deficit) and needed to put those dollars to use somewhere and found that use back in the United States.

In short, the lesson learned should apply more uniquely to taxing entities that do not have the power of currency creation, who are not monetary sovereign. Like states and local governments, but interesting enough also members of the Euro zone.

Within Kansas, if you are going to do a good assessment, you'll also look at start points when comparing economic growth or job growth. This is because Kansas did not suffer nearly as badly during the past recession due to strong prices of crops and oil and so had reduced slack for growth. This does not mean that I'm making any claim about the experiment, just that I've seen some bad analysis that used places like California at the bottom of the recession and comparing to Kansas who didn't hit rock bottom after the housing crash.","&gt; Every penny they spend, they must first tax.

They can't borrow and repay with future tax? Deficit spending only occurs in governmental entities with the power to create currency?

Wealth isn't finite. Smith, Ricardo, Bastiat, and even Marx agree. There is no need to ""recycle wealth"". Instead, we should seek to prevent [rent-seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking) behavior.

The money and wealth you aim to tax, has already been taxed according to laws and it belongs to its owner's estate.

Estate taxes don't raise nearly as much money as you think they do, and they actually are pretty easily avoided. Just ask the Kennedys.

In practice, inheritance taxes (like almost all other taxes) disproportionately affect the upper-middle class, or the lower-rich. They never actually hit the absurdly wealthy you are aiming for. By taking from those most equipped to ascend to the highest ranks of society, you effectively remove social mobility instead of enhancing it.",7132,11,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: I'm under the impression estates are taxed at 35% in excess of 1mm. That's already fairly high.

With a higher tax, tax avoidance would go way up. Parents would hire their children and pay them, engage in favor trading, understate values, et cetera. Life insurance would become extremely popular - or do you also want to tax life insurance proceeds above 1mm?

People near death would be more tempted to liquidate their investments late in life and spend it all on _whatever_. 

People would work less hard and likely retire earlier.

Most large estates are going to be businesses. If the estate tax was ""very high"" then the new owner of a business would have to do some sort of forced sale to pay the taxes which is likely inefficient.

People would engage in more wasteful investments in their children. I'd expect that the cost of education would increase. If it is inefficient to leave money to children, then sending your children to a wastefully expensive school for a marginal increase in their income makes sense.

Inheritance seems highly unfair; however, I'm not sure the benefits of a higher inheritance tax would outweigh the costs.","It actually only kicked in after 5 million dollars in 2011.  I don't think many people ever reach that level of wealth, anyway. ",7132,14,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

The estates of the rich aren't piles of cash under mattresses, they areinvestments, eg companies. Moving spending from investment to consumption is bad for economic growth, especially for a country like the US with too little investment and too much consumer spending to begin with.

That's why economists favor consumption taxes and not capital gains taxes - consumption is bad, investment is good.

Always remember the goal of estate tax is to wrest control of wealth from the few so that it can be re-distributed to the rest. The ultimate goal is to recycle productive assets back into the economy, rather than them piling up in the hands of a few wealthy families. Without the tax you will ultimately have children who live off of interest and dividends their parents earned. This creates an ever increasing disparity between the super rich and everyone else.

If you force people to spend their money before they die, you are stimulating growth and consumption. If rich old people pay their kids salaries as a means of avoidance, then the government gets a cut of payroll taxes. If they gift it before death, then the government gets the taxes sooner. Don't forget that life insurance companies aren't stupid. They won't offer absurdly large policies for people near death at extremely cheap rates. It will cost money which is ultimately being recycled back into the economy.

Business do not pay an estate tax. Businesses (if you're talking about corporations) have an unlimited life and distributions upon liquidation are taxed.

Your argument that education would become more expensive is incorrect. I don't know how you link the estate tax to rising costs in education. With that logic, EVERYTHING should become more expensive, but the reality is, the number of people who are actually paying estate tax in proportion to the number of people demanding services like education is very, very small. They will not drive up costs for those types of services.

There has always been a healthy fear among those who support the estate tax that increasing concentrations of wealth would create dynastic-like conditions for a select few families, who could then use their wealth to gain increasing control over the government. It is very important for the wealthy to realize that there must be enough opportunities (or at least the perception there are) for the poor to get ahead. Recent uprisings in the Middle East highlight this observation. When people feel the system is genuinely stacked against them, they start to protest. The rich can only insulate themselves from this chaos for so long.",7132,17,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

The wars in the Middle East are just as much wars of ideas as they are wars of ... well, shooting dudes. bin Laden's significance was not only in that he directed al Qaeda, but in that he was a symbol for al Qaeda - as [Bruce Riedel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Riedel) points out in [this article in the Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/how-the-killing-of-bin-laden-has-crippled-al-qaeda/256505/): 

&gt;There is no question a year after bin Laden's death that the al-Qaida core has been devastated by his loss, because he had achieved mythic status as the Robin Hood of international terrorism who the sheriff couldn't catch, and at the time of his death he was still the boss who ran the organization and kept its archives ... Now that myth has been destroyed and bin Laden has been brought to justice.

The article also points out that the organization has effectively been crippled by this - Osama bin Laden's replacement, al-Zawahiri, is nowhere near as effective as a symbol for new recruits. You can here another publication's take on that [here](http://www.dw.de/al-qaeda-still-suffers-from-bin-ladens-death/a-15921824). Key quote:

&gt;Osama bin Laden had a personality that was able to attract many young men in the Arabic world and also in the West and South Asia. Ayman al-Zawahiri is not inspiring. He is respected but he is not loved like bin Laden was.

And if you really want conventional success out of this operation, the Atlantic additionally points out -

&gt;[g]iven the treasure trove of intelligence gathered during the operation, it is probably no coincidence that the raid was followed by a series of successful strikes against senior bin Laden lieutenants....In fact, in roughly the last year U.S. intelligence officials claim to have killed half of al-Qaida's top 20 leaders in raids and attacks by armed drones...

Basically, tl;dr - Osama bin Laden absolutely should've been considered our top priority despite not having active operational significance. He was still their celebrity leader, and killing him removes a big symbol to any who wished to join him. As Riedel alluded to, it's hard to believe in Robin Hood's victory after he's been shot. 

Of course, there's a new problem of al-Qaeda affiliates becoming more empowered and separated. But  as these groups become more separated, I think they'll be much less effective. Feel free to challenge that opinion though, you never know how these things will develop.

Weighing the deaths of those unvaccinated against the lives  saved  by the war -

It's *really* hard  to make that  comparison when you're crafting policy. It's not like the CIA planned to sacrifice so many polio afflicted children to kill Osama bin Laden - if the plan goes well, then no innocents die as a result of distrust of vaccines, and the war is over sooner and we accomplish a primary military goal. If it doesn't, then we dismiss the claims as a conspiracy and hope people continue to get vaccines (and maybe radicals preventing them from doing so gets us more support in the war). 

Even if it was thought of as a direct trade off, it's really hard to predict the human lives lost and saved by ""some radicals become anti-vax"" and ""Osama bin Laden goes away"".  While it's easy to predict *some* or *many* will die, it's not as if there are clear results of these scenarios that can be drawn from  counter factuals before the  operation. 

----
Again, I think the operation was a mistake, and probably shouldn't have happened. I just don't think it's an inherently unjustified operation - if we had pulled it off, gotten information about Osama bin Laden, and not been discovered ( as was very possible ) this would have been amazingly helpful. 

It's worth remembering that [the operation Wikipedia lists was set up in Abbottabad, after we suspected bin Laden of hiding there, the year we killed him.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency#Use_of_vaccination_programs) We weren't just dicking around here. On the other hand, you can just as easily say the program wasn't needed at that point - in hindsight, I'd agree. I'm just not to upset we did it. 

So blah, that's my opinion. Sorry for lengthy post, got interested in this  subject and was bored!

"B: **Question 1:** The US is a big country with diverse and shifting interests. This brings complexity and nuance to the issues our representatives deal with in Washington. Does the whole idea of asking them to ""pledge"" something before they're elected lead to good policy? It seems like the resulting inflexibility would be a hindrance to good governance. 

**Answer:** It's a good question. People often say, The Americans for Tax Reform, the group that I head, asks all candidates for office — Federal, State, governors, state legislators, congressmen, senators, presidents — to sign a pledge to the American people, to the people of their state, and to the country, that they will oppose and vote against any effort to raise the tax burden, to raise taxes. The reason we do so is that the tendency of politicians is to expand the power of the government — State government, Federal government, city government — at the expense of consumers and taxpayers and citizens. And so, this is a commitment, saying, 'If I run for office, I may do many foolish things; I may invade small countries I can't pronounce, but I will not raise your taxes.' It doesn't answer all the world's questions, but it gets at quite a few of them. And the reason why you want to say to people, ""don't raise taxes,"" or you want them to make the commitment if they're willing to — I don't want someone promising you they won't raise taxes if they intend to raise taxes; the pledge is important and useful because people keep it when they run for office, and they make that commitment or they don't — 

The Constitution, as an example, is a collection of things the government is *not allowed to do.* There's a small list of things the government is supposed to do, and then a long list of amendment, the 10 parts of the Bill of Rights, are all things the government's not allowed to do. They're not allowed to tell you what church to go to. They're not allowed to tell you what you can say or can't say. They're not allowed come and rifle through your papers. They're not allowed to steal your guns or interfere with your Second Amendment rights. There's no ifs, ands or buts on this stuff. They're not allowed to. So I think you need restrictions on the power of government, whether it's a democracy or a monarchy, or however you choose your leaders, you want Constitutional restrictions on what that government is allowed to do and what they're forbidden from doing. And the pledge is a way to say, 'By the way, when you elect me, here's what I'm not going to do... I'm not going to raise your taxes.'

And that also tells you a lot about a candidate, because somebody who's not going to raise your taxes has to govern. Governing is making decisions on how much you spend and what you spend it on. Tax increasing is what politicians do rather than govern. 'We've been doing 100 different things, somebody wants to do one more thing... we'll just add it and raise taxes.'

Well, how about making decisions about what's important, what's less important? Are there things you've been doing for the last 20 years that don't make sense any more? Maybe they never made sense. Maybe they made sense 20 or 200 years ago, but not now. And so, the decision not to raise taxes is also the decision to reform government so that it costs less.

The whole thing that drives the Ryan budget plan — the Republican plan to reduce the size and scope of government, to block grant means-tested welfare programs (like Clinton did with Aid to Families with Dependent Children), and to fix entitlements so they don't bankrupt the country in years to come — was all driven by 'how do you do this without raising taxes?' And from that — ""we're not raising taxes"" — we got government reforms that will work and that I think will be very helpful.

So, it's very important for somebody to take tax increases off the table, because if you don't take tax increases off the table, you never get to reforming government. It just never happens. And, go through history.","&gt; I may invade small countries I can't pronounce

B: That's because Reagan shifted the tax burden away from investment and onto wages. ,"&gt;  ATR was founded by Grover Norquist at the request of President Reagan, but Reagan himself approved increased taxes to combat a rising deficit and debt burden. Were all those instances of Reagan failing to govern?

To some extent. Ideally those tax increases should have been paid with spending cuts. But Reagan was a President, not an absolutist king. He was very adept of getting legislative bipartisan support for his initiatives, unlike recent Presidents. 

The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act didn't actually raise taxes - it repealed tax cuts that had not yet taken place. The TEFRA passed the House with 226 votes - 123 from Republicans, 123 from Democrats. Reagan agreed to sign into law under the promise from Congress of a $3 reduction in spending for every $1 in increase in revenue. A pretty sweet deal, but Congress failed to deliver. - Source 1 [On the other hand, most of Dole's tax increase was actually the partial repeal of future tax cuts that had been enacted in 1981 but had not yet taken place. Despite Dole's bill, taxpayers received more than $375 billion in tax cuts over the following three years.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_gist/1996/08/the_biggest_tax_increase_in_history.html).

The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 was a bill introduced by a Democrat and sponsored by another 14. It passed the House with 268 to 155 and pretty much like the TEFRA, most of the revenue it raised came from repealing future tax cuts. - Basically the same sources. [1984: The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (HR 4170) represented a substantial step toward deficit reduction, adding $103 billion to revenues over ten years, mainly by closing unwarranted loopholes (...) was enacted by a vote of 268 to 155](http://www.ctj.org/html/gore.htm)

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was another bipartisan bill with the aim of being revenue neutral. Actually, it was the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that prompted the creation of the ATR - as a lobby group with the aim of promoting it.  Source [The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was given impetus by a detailed tax-simplification proposal from President Reagan's Treasury Department, and was designed to be tax-revenue neutral because Reagan stated that he would veto any bill that was not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986) Source [ Americans for Tax Reform was founded in the mid-80s inside the Reagan White House. Norquist was tapped to head the group as an in-house operation to build support for the 1986 tax reform bill](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/americans-for-tax-reform) - 

The other two tax increases mentioned didn't raise any marginal income tax [per the Politifact article cited above - (...)legislation making permanent a 16-cent federal excise tax on a pack of cigarettes... (...) extended the telephone excise tax and eliminated a real estate tax deduction loophole.
)](http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2012/jun/25/gerry-connolly/rep-gerry-connolly-says-reagan-raised-taxes-during/)

The taxpayer's protection pledge states:

&gt; I will: ONE, oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; *and TWO, oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates* [source](http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/Federal%20Pledge.pdf) pdf

That gives Congressmen enough leeway to work on tax restructuring -close loopholes and curb tax code expenditures- without violating the pledge. 

Overall, the tax burden declined during the Reagan Administration and most of the tax increases were repeals of scheduled tax cuts.

For your Jamie Dimon example you are saying good things in a way that makes them sound like bad things. If it is morally right for a man that makes $1,000 dollars a year to keep and use that money then why is it morally wrong for a man who makes 14 million to keep and use that money?

In a sense, yes. He is correct that capital gains revenues rise and fall in response to changes in the capital gains tax rate. I think that's a pretty obvious byproduct of the fluctuation. But he's essentially answering his own question here, since the original quote said nothing about capital gains revenue. It was all about growth or damage to the overall economy.

&gt; If it is morally right for a man that makes $1,000 dollars a year to keep and use that money then why is it morally wrong for a man who makes 14 million to keep and use that money?

It's not morally wrong. But if either man uses that money to earn *more* money, then the gain (not the original principal, just the gain) is new income, and should be taxed as such. ""The same dollar"" should not be taxed. On that I agree with Mr. Norquist. But calling the gain on investment income ""the same dollar"" is misleading.

If the man who makes $1,000 puts that money in the bank, earns 10% interest, and withdraws $1,100 at the end of the year, only the $100 is subject to tax, not the original $1,000. Similarly, I believe Mr. Dimon's $1.4 million annual returns on investment should be taxed, but not the original $14 million invested.

","**Question 5:** Do you believe that there is ever a good time or reason to increase marginal tax rates on people and/or businesses, or are there absolutely no circumstances that would make that preferable to you? 

**Answer:** There are absolutely no circumstances under which it's a good idea to raise marginal taxes. The government is too large now both in Washington, DC and in all 57 states – the government is too big. We need the government smaller; we need tax rates lower; we need taxes lower. Raising taxes at a time when the government's larger than it needs to be -- umm we used to get by with total government less than 10% of the economy -- less than 10% of the economy up until like World War 2, okay? We now got the government swallowing 30%. This is not reasonable; this is unacceptable; this is too big.

"A: **Question 6:** As a small business, I pay an income tax of 35% whereas my big business counterparts pay a meek 15% in capital gains tax by way of sophisticated international accounting practices. Why should I vote Republican when the party supports a tax code and other governmental powers that put me at a disadvantage? Why do you not present a plan that closes unfair advantages / tax loopholes and have members of congress sign onto that?

**Answer:** Actually, I am in favor of just that. If you're looking at Congressman Dave Camp, is the Republican in the House who runs the Weighs and Means Committee, the tax writing committee. Under the Constitution, only the House can introduce tax changes, up or down or reform. His tax reform moves in exactly that direction. It's not all spelled out, but we have a fairly good idea of the direction they're going and I think you'll be very pleased with the proposal that he puts forward in terms of moving in the right direction. Maybe not as far as you or I would go, but everybody should pay the same marginal tax rates, not different for different people.

We do have a challenge. We have a 35% top corporate rate, OK? I just had a presentation in our Wednesday meeting here in D.C.  There's a gentleman from Hungary who runs a think tank there. They have a 16 percent marginal tax rate there, in Hungary. We're 35, Hungary's 16. And then, the Swedes were there. There at, I think, 22 percent. Swedes are at 22, we're at 35. This is not reasonable. The European average, OECD countries, is at 25. We should move to 25 as the opening bid. Stupider than France is not where we want to be on tax policy.

"A: **Question 7:** Which tax deductions would you like to see eliminated from the tax code as part of an effort to ""simplify"" things? Assuming that rates were also cut, but the net result was an increase in revenue, would you score this as a tax increase or a tax decrease?

**Answer:** For the first part, there are lots of tax deductions that I think I would rather move away from and have lower rates. One proposal that was put forward I think years ago by Steven Moore - now writing for The Wall Street Journal editorial page - which was to set up an alternative tax code. So you have the present tax code which is a mess and has thousands of pages and a second tax code [that is] optional, optional [where if] you like the present system? Stay there. Be happy. You want to move over to the other one permanently - you can't do it one year and then change back and forth - but you can choose the other one and have one simple rate and few, if any, deductions in credits. So you could go very radical in the limitation on how many deductions and credits you have because it's an option. I would like to live in a world where the government doesn't advantage or disadvantage any activities, one simple very low rate, and I think most people over time would in fact shift to the low rate with few deductions or credits. I realize that some people have organized their lives by how they've structured things, by buying a big house, and other stuff that you do because they're tax advantages. Well, over time you might want to shift and not live for the tax rules but live for how you want to make decisions not how tax writing committees want to make decisions for you. So I think that that it would be a good idea to move towards few deductions and credits but I like that idea of making it an option. You want to stay in the present mess? You can. The rest of us may want to move over to the simpler code system. But it doesn't scare anybody because if somebody thinks ""Oh, I've got this tax credit that's important to me"" then please, stay there. Nobody's telling you that you have to do anything other than what you're doing.

Answer for Part 2:

Tax reductions/tax cuts taking the top rate from 90/70, from 70/50, from 50/20, every time we did those things the government would have more money from rich people because people paid more in taxes because they worked more and because they didn't try and organize their lives around hiding from the tax rates. And so that actually raises revenue but it is a tax cut. I don't think you can look somebody in the eye and say ""We're going to tax you at 90, we're now going to tax you at 70 and that's a tax increase"". It's a tax rate cut that, actually because of economic growth, helps the entire economy and the government ends up raising more money with a lower rate. So, cutting the capital gains tax and cutting the income tax rates, cutting the business tax rates, going to faster depreciation or expensing for business investment, all those things are cuts in taxes but they actually raise money for the government because they're so helpful to strengthening the overall economy.","That first answer terrifies me, and I hope he didn't think that through.

"B: Minus one more option, yes","**Question 8:** Of the 34 nations ranked by health expenditure in a 2013 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United States spends the most at 17.7% of its GDP (based on 2011 data). It is more than France, Germany or the UK, which all have universal health care. How do you justify your stance opposing the regulation of health care considering the current comparatively large expenditure of your nation's GDP on health care?

**Answer:** OK, one, wealthy nations like to spend more on health care because they can, because they can afford it. I think it's a good thing to spend money on health care — not unnecessarily, but it's a good sign. People living longer, you know, 70 and 80 year-olds spend more on health care than 20 year-olds, and we have more 70 and 80 year-olds than we used to have, because people are living longer. This is a *good* thing, not a bad thing. I know the Social Security actuarial people think it's a bad thing, but they're wrong. It's a good thing to have lots of older people, because someday, I hope to be one, and I intend to spend lots on health care when I get there. But, we don't want to waste any money on health care, but we also don't want to do what these nice people in Europe that you're [referencing are doing], which is rationing. Which is telling people, ""Well, we're not telling you you can't have your kidney operation, we're just telling you you're going to have to get in line and it's going to take months, and you may not live that long. That's rationing, by putting people in lines, and you don't want the government rationing care, you want a competitive... now, I'm very unhappy with both Obamacare — more government control with fewer options, and people are whining because Obama's law has gotten a whole bunch of insurance companies to cancel their policies because they're illegal, because the government says 'policies have to have x, y and z in them,' and they make them too expensive for anybody to buy, so they cancel them. The government ought not be in the business of telling you what your insurance should look like. You should decide.

But, if Obamacare had never happened, we had a mess before Obamacare. It wasn't as big a mess, but it was still a mess. And you had 50 states — some people say 57, but at least 50 states — where each of those states set up a bunch of rules, and said 'if you want to sell insurance in New Jersey,' there were I think 48 different mandates: you have to insure for this and this.

Well, what if I don't want to insure for all sorts of different things and uh, drug rehabilitation. I don't want to pay for that because it's not something I'm going to make use of, or for various other things that I'm not interested in? I want to be able to choose what I insure for, not have the government tell me I have to. And the reason some states, like New Jersey, have more than Iowa, is that the legislature, and so on, are more corrupt, and they've got all these special interests coming in saying, ""make everybody who buys insurance use my stuff."" And that's where these mandates come in. And Obama did that in a big way with Obamacare. There's lots of stuff you have to pay for that you may have no interest in that subsidizes some special interest because Obama's rule-makers make you pay for something you don't want to pay for, and that raises the cost.

So, we should keep costs low. We should allow people to buy insurance anywhere they want to and from any state, from any business they want to, and not have rules. Right now Obamacare, the government has to approve your insurance. Well screw them. It's not their insurance, it's your insurance. It's my insurance. We should be able to decide what we pay for and what we want, not the government.

"C: **Question 9:** Your organization states that, ""Americans for Tax Reform supports an all-of-the-above approach to powering America. Every source of energy should be allowed to compete on a level playing field."" Can you expand upon ATR's goal of expanding America's energy supply?

**Answer:** That got to the earlier question we were talking about where I oppose, and Americans for Tax Reform opposes, all special subsidies, tax breaks, for particular industries. There are a whole bunch of subsidies for so-called green energy or alternative energy sources, and some tax breaks for oil or natural gas. Get rid of all that stuff. Get rid of all of those special deals, and just say, 'hey, you want to bring natural gas or oil or nuclear or wind power or magic bean power or whatever you've got and sell it to people, then do so, but don't be asking for a subsidy; just do it.'

So I think it's very important that we... now there's a lot of stuff... fracking... we can now find natural gas in places nobody thought they had it before. All sorts of States are doing it. New York has decided not to do it in New York, but in Pennsylvania a lot of people are producing... 10 percent of the natural gas in the country is now being made in Pennsylvania, which did not used to be thought of as some cross between Qatar and Kuwait or something, but Pennsylvania is now doing quite well. A lot of people are getting rich... farmers and stuff, 'cause they have to poke a whole in your farmland and they have to pay for it.

So, I think there's some great stuff. There's a lot of energy in Alaska and the Alaskans get very whiny when a bunch of rich liberals sitting in New York City who've never been to Alaska decide that they can't poke holes in the ground in Alaska and get oil and sell it to people. I think that's kind of silly and it's kind of imperialistic to run other people's lives from afar and tell them what they can and can't do with their own property and their own stuff.

So, I think we should be drilling off shore. The only way California's ever going to get out of its bankrupt situation, where the underfunded liabilities of the government worker pension system, which is bankrupting the state — and it's gotten worse, not better, under Governor Brown and recent situations — is to tap all that lovely underground oil and natural gas that's off shore, like they do in Britain and Norway. But very carefully, making sure you don't damage any birds or anything, but that would solve much, if not all of, the California problem that's otherwise going to break the taxpayers of the State, or move everybody with a job to Arizona, Nevada and Wyoming.

So, I think there's a lot we can do on energy. The government just has to get out of their way. The government doesn't have to do anything. You've got a project, 'I've got a project.' What does it require? The government's got to be really smart and... whoops, that's not gonna work, is it? If all the government has to do is get out of the way, your project might work and energy independence, meaning producing as much energy as we want, the idea being that we should be worried about buying energy from Mexico or Canada has always struck me as vaguely stupid. Okay, we don't need to be completely independent of other places, but let's not be unnecessarily requiring to buy energy from other countries if we could produce it here.

","Wait - hasn't California turned itself around? Isn't the supermajority Democrat administration having a great time with their budget? That was the impression I was getting from the last couple years of news articles, but I am open to correction.

Also, when Alaska sells all that oil, doesn't the wealth go mostly to private corporations, not the citizens? And isn't a lot of the land with the oil etc federally owned land that gets leased out to oil companies when it *is* drilled, not privately owned land where we're telling people not to drill?

Even filibusters are prohibited.

In the case of a multilateral agreement, US lawmakers would then be faced with the considerable risk that the other parties will ratify it and lower trade barriers between them, while the US would be left behind if it failed to ratify.

&gt; President Trump’s prior assertion that he wished to ‘totally destroy’ the Johnson Amendment with this order has proven to be a textbook case of ‘fake news.’

Pepperidge Farm remembers when fake news was a term referring specifically to articles that had the appearance of legitimate news, but were actually fiction (or distortions of the truth intended to reshape reality). Trump (et al) has degraded this term to refer to any presentation of facts that are distasteful.  

Here, the ACLU has used the term here to refer to a (campaign) lie, or a statement of intent that he has failed to make real, further degrades the term.

I object to this because, without the term ""fake news"" to refer to *actual fake news* [sic], fake news gets even more dangerous. The water is muddy, and that term helped clarify it.

Isn't that exactly what Trump does? When he is saying this order ""totally destroys"" the Johnson Amendment, when it really doesn't, and his statements are meant to make it seem like he's taking hard action against 'attacks on religion', would that not be a) distortion of the truth and b) reshaping what reality shows?

Think of it this way: if you saw a Breitbart article exclaiming that Trump's executive order totally destroyed the Johnson Amendment and has struck a strong blow for religious liberty, would you not call that fake news? It's fiction. It's false. It really does not do that. It's more than a distasteful presentation, it distorts the truth in a way that misleads its audience.

It certainly isn't slander, as a commenter below suggested. Trump has had a history of saying one thing while the opposite is true. Most recently with healthcare, for example.","&gt; It's fiction. It's false. It really does not do that.

&gt;if you saw a Breitbart article exclaiming that Trump's executive order totally destroyed the Johnson Amendment and has struck a strong blow for religious liberty, would you not call that fake news?

Yes - I agree completely.  But the difference is that Breitbart would be news (""news""), and therefor capable of being fake news.  The words coming straight out of Trump's mouth is a statement, not reporting on a statement.  When it comes directly from Trump, it's a lie; when a lie comes from the news, then it can be fake news.  

There's an important difference.  Both are bad, but a lie coming from a liar is a known quantity - something we've been dealing with for millennia.  But fake news is a new phenomenon, one that digs into the core of our concepts of media and trust - because all media has a bias, and shapes stories to align with the bias, but it's fake news when it crosses the line and finally departs altogether from ""truth.""  The presence of fake news pulls our line of acceptability away from where it was - but does it pull it toward truth, meaning, does it make more news organizations untrustworthy?  or does it pull it in the other direction, making more bullshit news acceptable?

Current revenue generated by sales tax in the United States is [$490 billion](http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/year_revenue_2016USrn_17rs1n_40#usgs302). That would turn into $2.248 trillion if tax levels were increased to the rates they are in the Nordic countries.

What additional funds would be available if military spending was cut to NATO recommended levels, or Sweden's? NATO recommends 2% of GDP, which would be roughly $340 billion, $276 million less than current levels. 0.7% would be around $119 billion, a potential savings of $497 billion. Both of those totals are still relatively modest compared to the revenue totals yielded from a VAT equivalent. That's the real difference, not defense spending. (Obviously very imprecise calculations, but the difference is still pretty significant).

From the Nordic perspective, the Finlands and Swedens of the world are never going to have the responsibilities of a regional or great power - they don't have the economy or population for it. If the US, for some reason, abdicated from its European responsibilities, I doubt we'd see defense spending increase a great deal, but rather more emphasis on the European Union's potential role as a collective security organization (facilitating a joint nuclear deterrent, conventional military support from larger countries).

Norway is around 5 million people, Sweden around 9.5 and Finland also around 5. 
This is in effect, the administrative equivalent of running New York State divided between three countries. Northern Europe is, in my view proof positive of the whole ""small is beautiful"" thesis. 
The United States by contrast, spans a continent and has a population 17 times larger. 
Nordic states, are very productive and exceptional places to live, but (and yes I am generalizing here) bureaucracies can remain small and lean by comparison. A Federal attempt to set up social programs like those in Sweden would be absolutely gargantuan projects, ministering to a group probably orders of magnitude larger than the entire Nordic population. This is not to say that it is bad, but rather only point out what is in my view the main obstacle. 

For the Nordic countries, I doubt a large enough tax base exists for them to acquire and maintain the strategic systems necessary to deter a country like...Russia. They all rely upon mutual self defense and some rely upon NATO. I think if the Nordic countries did up defense spending to 2%, the marginal benefit wouldn't be that great. Maybe each country might stand up a new Brigade or Regiment or increase readiness rates or something, but in strategic terms, this isn't disruptive. Sure, it would result in either a tax increase or a cut to some services, but I doubt a raise to 2% of GDP would cause a societal shift away from the welfare state.

&gt;Fundamentally, our tax dollars are to be used, as the Constitution puts it, to provide and promote the common welfare.

that's not what the constitution says.  

&gt;Similarly, federal grants are given to those states that have trouble providing for their own citizens. This comes in many forms from welfare programs given to directly to individuals (like medicaid, financial assistance, food stamps, and energy assistance), to larger programs targeted at whole communities (like education grants to local schools, grants to cities to build infrastructure, and farm subsidies). Some states, however, are better able to provide for their own citizens and do not need to receive as much money from the federal government to assist with these programs. Generally these states can better provide for their citizens because they pay more in state taxes.

That would be a valid argument if states were destined for some reason to always be poor and unable to pay for their own programs. But a major reason why they are too poor to pay for their programs is that their state and local taxes are too low, and thus they require more aid from the federal government.

&gt;&gt;Why should the people of my state subsidize another state for their own fiscal irresponsibility?

&gt;They shouldn't.  And if you think they are, the proper response is to abolish the programs you think they are abusing, not force them to pay taxes for programs that they don't want.

Apologies, I laid out the explanation to someone else.

One, the ""red states"" have been poorer than the blue states since the civil war, when the people from the blue states burned down much of the south.

Two, there is no state that ""keeps cutting taxes."" state and local taxes have done nothing but increase. for decades. States will occasionally elect a government that cuts things back for a year or two in a recession, but it never stops the long term upward trend.

Three, while the red states are poorer than the blue for a long time, they have been growing much faster for the last few decades. The blue states are not investing in long term growth, they'd living on inherited capital, and in some cases, rapidly spending it down.

&gt;I am also in favor of that, but given as that is not going to happen, it is a stupid idea to raise people's taxes to pay for the fiscal irresponsibility of other states.

"B: It may not be a MORAL defense, but perhaps its helps to distinguish whether the purpose of tax deductions is to be ""fair"" or to add some economic incentive to a desired behavior.
If we think of deduction as an economic incentive to do the ""right"" thing then SALT deductions might make more sense. Items such as student loan interest, charitable donations,  and medical costs are deductible because we want people to educate themselves, help out the less fortunate, and help prevent medically induced poverty. We increase tax on cigarettes, alcohol, and other behaviors we want to discourage. The criticism of the estate tax is that it double taxes income, but we justify this because we are trying to discourage the accumulation of excessive generational wealth. Alternatively, SALT deductions remove the double taxing of income because we want to encourage states to be pro-active in improving schools and roads, and increasing their emergency slush funds. This gets into where tax law moves away from what is ""fair"" into the economics of influencing behavior. The same way we structure the tax code to encourage people to be better citizens, so should we structure it to promote states bettering themselves.

But that's *not* the argument WalletHub makes when they look at [federal dependency](https://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700/), which shows hardly any correlation between effective tax rates and their metric for federal dependency. If states were actually using federal aid to artificially cut their own taxes, you'd expect a much stronger negative correlation.

Whether a state is a net recipient or contributor of federal funds is explained much more by that state's GDP than by the state [tax rates](https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-states-to-be-a-taxpayer/2416/) for a median taxpayer. The correlation between those effective tax rates and federal dependency, using WalletHub's numbers, is only about -0.13. That's pretty much nothing.

When I looked at that my first thought was, well, maybe median rates are a poor indicator since higher earners are much more likely to itemize and take SALT deductions. Turns out that's not a great argument either.

Even if you look at the correlation between federal dependency and the maximum of [state and local sales tax](https://taxfoundation.org/state-and-local-sales-tax-rates-in-2017/) or the [highest state income tax brackets](https://taxfoundation.org/state-individual-income-tax-rates-brackets-2017/), the correlation between a state's tax rate and its dependency on federal funding just isn't there.

The only rate that makes sense for this comparison is property taxes, which do in fact have a moderate correlation with WalletHub's measure of federal dependency. State property taxes are still deductible in the house's tax bill, though.

Relying on federally subsidized states to raise their own taxes to fund welfare programs in the federal governments stead is sort of wishful thinking regardless, but it doesn't seem backed up by the data either.

https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-highest-lowest-tax-burden/20494/","I would agree that it certainly seems politically motivated, but that doesn't mean blue states should use dubious reasons to defend SALT either.

The argument that's been coming up in this conversation is that, as I understand it, SALT is an incentive for more local governance which blue states are taking advantage of more often than red states, and that this explains the differences in federal funding. So instead of removing SALT, red states should just raise their taxes and replace federal programs with (presumably more efficient) local ones.

If you look at the analysis on the pages being linked, though, federal dependency depends on how rich or poor a state is much more than that state's tax rates. Tax rates or tax burdens correlate quite weakly with federal dependency* while tax income, average SALT deduction, or other things measured in dollars show a stronger correlation since they include an effect from that state's GDP and not just the state's tax policy.

So if federally dependent states can't wean themselves off that funding by raising taxes, then this particular argument for defending SALT doesn't seem coherent.

\* Take the numbers from WalletHub and throw them in Excel or otherwise look at the correlations yourself. Total tax burden vs federal dependency is *r* = -0.15, or *r* = -0.20 if you go by rank. That seems too low to draw serious conclusions from to me. 

EDIT: In fact, here's a [picture](https://imgur.com/a/H8dF1), color coded for how each state voted in 2016 (and omitting Delaware since it's an outlier/tax haven, which improves the numbers a little but we're still looking at r = -0.24).",7340,129,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"A: &gt;I bet if you normalize both axis 0-1 and plot a line y=x, you will find that Red states cluster on the low tax-federally dependent side of the curve.

You're not wrong. [Scaled](https://imgur.com/a/V2r81), with quadrants and y=x sloppily added in paint.

However, while red states are more likely overall to have lower tax burdens their federal dependencies are still all over the map. West Virginia and Mississippi already have above average tax burdens but they're some of the most dependent states, for example. Meanwhile Florida, Alaska, and Oklahoma are in the low dependence quadrant but have some of the lowest tax burdens on the graph (and Alaska is unusual, sure, but Oklahoma?)

Ultimately, though, I don't think our interpretations of the data are incompatible. It's possible for red states to be more dependent *and* for dependency to be mostly independent from tax policy. Blue states are less dependent but have a wide range of tax burdens. Red states have lower taxes and a wide range of dependency. The result is that red states are more likely to be dependent than blue ones, but not that high dependency red states could change this by raising taxes (since plenty of low dependency red states have similar or lower tax rates.)

Eliminating SALT is almost certainly a partisan move that will redistribute wealth from blue states to red ones. That doesn't automatically make the federal dependency argument for SALT deductions correct, however, *even if* blue states are less dependent on average.

(If you compared what each state *spends* its tax revenue on it might be the case that red states aren't spending effectively, which you could model by artificially lowering their tax burdens depending on some efficiency gap. I'm not keen on looking into that, since it's much thornier, but it might give you the correlation you want. Then you're in the tenuous position of hoping red states will raise taxes to fund programs that red states are traditionally against, though. That's less an argument in favor of SALT deductions and more of an argument for stronger federal regulation to bring backwards states up to par.)","You turned that graph around quick!

So I guess you are thinking from a pure calculus of the number stand point, I'm coming at it from more of a social angle. Let say you live and pay taxes in a Blue state, with high taxes and the following conditions happen:

1.) Red states tend to get back more than they give from the federal government

2.) The federal government, controlled by Republicans, will be effectively raising taxes for people in high tax states which tend to be blue by getting rid of one of the oldest parts of the income tax code. 

The first point alone is a tolerable injustice, but when you get to 2), it crosses a line for some since it seems to accelerate the injustice of 1).

"A: &gt; but what in the fuck does that have to do with this tax bill specifically targeting blue states and creating a larger imbalance at the federal level

The imbalance does not exist because Federal tax policy targets blue states. The imbalance exists because  federal tax policy is progressive and taxes the wealthy in order to pay benefits to the poor. Coincidentally, the wealthy are concentrated in blue states, and the poor in red states. It also tends to build military bases in areas where land is cheap so you can have a lot of it. Surprise surprise, land is much cheaper in Georgia then California (although California does have several incredibly large bases). 

&gt; I don't see what the discussion of the tax bill, are you arguing it will have a positive effect on the cost of living? Because there no basis for that.

What I mentioned was the effects on weakening the Mortgage Interest Deduction (MID). Housing cost is the biggest factor in overall cost of living, especially in California. Yet the MID [has no effect on home ownership, it just pushes people to get larger and more expensive houses](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137712000514). By weakening this incentive, the federal government gets out of the game of distorting housing values and driving up the COL. 

&gt; I don't think people like you realize that the cause of high prices in California is crazy demand with tons of people moving here and the occurance of high salaries. You can fomain about policy all day long but that is 95% of the reason prices are high. Also show me somewhere where home owners don't protect their home prices.

Cost of living is a supply and demand problem. If salaries rise, so does demand. But if the state doesn't let the housing supply rise to meet demand, or energy production rise to meet demand, or any number of other goods now being competed by between more dollars then prices will rise. As to people moving here, [California has a big outmigration problem](http://www.ocregister.com/2017/04/23/leaving-california-after-slowing-the-trend-intensifies/) with 12,000 people net leaving the bay area last year. 

As to showing somewhere homeowners don't protect prices [here's a chart to what states have the most and least land use restrictions] (https://www.freedominthe50states.org/custom/land-use/frent/frtp/fwrluri/mindex). CATO is definitely right leaning, but its data is from the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index which from a cursory google search appears to be solid. So to answer your question as to where homeowners don't protect their home prices the answer is probably nowhere, but the NIBYism of Red States doesn't hold a candle to that of California and the North East. 

&gt; You must make nothing if the new standard deduction and child tax credit cancels out the SALT deduction for you to even out and get a couple hundred bucks back, cause for the vast majority of us here it raises our taxes.

Does it?

I'm better off than many Californians though because I have a good benefit package and healthcare, so I would venture to say I am probably around average if not above it. Using [this calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator#JtpTIVU9W7) my estimated state sales, income, and fuel taxes for 2017 are a bit over 4,000. Nowhere near where I would need to be to consider itemizing, its the MID that would probably make it worth my while. We can argue all day about what's middle class in California, but the term is so overused its almost meaningless at this point.

","FWIW I am ambivalent on the mortgage interest deduction, I'd like to keep it but I feel its ok to eliminate it too. The intent was to have more people buy homes but it really incentives to get yourself a huge mortgage.

https://www.npr.org/2017/11/08/562903260/breaking-down-the-concept-behind-the-mortgage-interest-deduction

However, I think the elimination of the SALT deduction is an attack on Federalism. I found a nice explanation by the [Governor's Lobby](https://www.nga.org/cms/policy-positions/executive-committee/principles-for-state-federal-relations) (yes the Governor's have a lobby)

&gt;2.2.1 Congress should not interfere with state revenue systems. The independent ability of states to develop their own revenue systems is a basic tenet of self government and our federalist system. The federal government should not enact any legislation or adopt any regulation that would preempt, either directly or indirectly, sources of state revenues, state tax bases, or state taxation methods.

Edit: made second to last sentence clear",7340,151,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: &gt; But if doing away with the SALT deductions interferes with state revenue systems does this mean that all Federal Taxes interfere with state revenue systems?

Maybe, but I'm not making that argument. I'm saying eliminating the SALT deduction will drive behaviors that will interfere with some State's ability to collect revenue. It can be a simple as: now that people can't deduct SALT, the state has no choice but to cut taxes or lose tax base. Perhaps there are good reasons for the State to tax and spend as they do. If you are thinking ""hell ya the federal government should push the States to lower their taxes"". I simply disagree and find this counter to the tenants of federalism and State sovereignty. 

&gt;the benefit goes to six states (California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas, and Pennsylvania)

Those 6 states account for over 40% of the nations GDP.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_GDP

I'm going to disagree with your DWL angle: Eliminating the salt deduction will effectively drive the behavior of people trying to avoid paying property tax and state income tax (easiest way is by downsizing or moving to another state) and sending a greater share of their money to the Federal government, who, in my opinion, use the money less wisely than local government in many ways.

The tax bill increases the deficit yet will probably raises my taxes and is extremely partisan. I find the only reason someone would support this bill is if their wealthy donors want them to. Perhaps this is why the corporate tax cuts were permanent, but the middle class tax cut for you and I expire.  
https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/republicans-slap-an-expiration-date-on-middle-class-tax-cuts/545996/","&gt; Those 6 states account for over 40% of the nations GDP.

Fair point. However, even within those states its not like the SALT deduction is getting distributed among the lower and middle classes. [93% of the benefit goes to those making over 100 thousand a year](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/individual-income-tax-expenditures-april-2017/t17-0114-tax-benefit-deduction-and), and 39% of it is going to the top 1% alone. Now its solely a matter of opinion if this is bad or not, but we would probably see a different picture if the poor and middle class could deduct against their FICA taxes as well, instead of just income taxes. 

&gt; Eliminating the salt deduction will effectively drive the behavior of people trying to avoid paying property tax and state income tax (easiest way is by downsizing or moving to another state) and sending a greater share of their money to the Federal government, who, in my opinion, use the money less wisely than local government in many ways.

But what I was arguing earlier is that peoples final tax bill is going to be similar whether the deduction stays or not. If they let the wealthy deduct their state and local taxes, then they're going to raise the income tax rate, or the capital gains rate, or lower other deductions. People's bottom line will remain the same overall, because we tax to pay for the programs that get enacted, not simply for the sake of taxing. And its been a long while since any programs have been rolled back in any meaningful sense. As to people downsizing or moving to another state, I find this to be a benefit of Federalism. Competition between the states is a good thing, and helps enhance the laboratory of democracy that a federal system gives us. 

&gt; Perhaps this is why the corporate tax cuts were permanent, but the middle class tax cut for you and I expire.

Maybe, [but recent history indicates they won't](https://www.cbpp.org/research/budget-deal-makes-permanent-82-percent-of-president-bushs-tax-cuts). 82 percent of the bush tax cuts were made permanent. Unless the political calculus around the middle class shifts significantly in the next decade, then in 2027 rates will go up on the rich, and the middle class cuts will be preserved. You could very well be correct and you're right to assume that since its how the bill is written, but [as I linked earlier](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-average-federal-tax-rates-all-households) this would be a huge break from a very long running trend.

I'd argue that the federal government incentivizing localities cut services so that it makes sense that the central government can be the sole provider to be the **exact opposite** of federalism. The central government should give deference to how the state see fit to spend their money.

My point is this: Fact: I will pay more, and people richer than me will pay less. Fact: Any gains from cutting the corporate rate will not exceed the deficit spending(There is no models to show that). 

Like I said, I would gladly pay more taxes to help reduce the deficit, as long as people richer than me were paying more as well as we are all in this together. If this included some spending cuts to defense or something to try to cover the deficit, and I was treated equally with super wealthy people and corporations, then I might consider it. But given that I am paying more, my state is disproportionately affected, we get no help towards the growing deficit, it is a extremely nominal cut for the people it does cut for, and a non-nominal cut for the richest and corporations, then frankly, this is an absolutely shit bill, and even congressmen have come out saying its a bill for their donors.

This combination meant that legislatures controlled, in the words of a famous governor, ""[a fucking valuable thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Blagojevich)"" but didn't much care who got the seat.  this meant they were pretty free to auction it to the highest bidder, with little worry about the consequences, and they did so.  repealing the 17th directly would just create the same dynamic, my solution wouldn't.

I'm confused by what you mean. How is that a benefit?

&gt;The lawmaking process is already accountable to the people directly through the House... And that same 'accountability to the people' necessarily comes with 'accountable to monied interests he/she is going to need to get reelected.'

I agree, that second part is politics. But you neglect to talk about voting - which is also required and fairly important to re-election.

I'm happy to agree to disagree. I don't see any benefit in a lifetime appointment. The Supreme court is extremely political, and the idea that they are not seems to me to be forced. They constantly rule on and change politics in this country. It's all they do, really. They don't preside over common criminals or land disputes - they re-write law with every single decision. It does not get more political, and many times their decisions - while they are supposed to be based in law - are seemingly made for no legal reason at all.

Just my opinion.","The benefit I see is that it makes the sitting judges as apolitical as possible; as much as every appointment stirs endless talking about 'litmus tests' and whatnot, ultimately it's a position that gets filled largely on the candidate's judicial bonafides over their politics.

But as things currently are, they're stomping on that brake not for real concerns over legality and/or the long term best interests of the country, but for the exact same baldly political agendas championed in the house.

We have fully political representation in the House.  If those 51% are really on the right side, the laws that come out of the house should stand up to a less political Senate and an apolitical judiciary.

"B: I think there is something to be said about the he said/she said aspect - because there is a variance of outcomes of just the speech itself.

There are positive/positive cases: lets say one person claims they invented something, only for another person to claim they invented the same. They both are positively motivated, with both individuals looking to gain social status or notoriety should they be proven truthful.

This trends more positive/negative. The victims in these cases already have been ushered onto the grand stage of media attention, they will likely profit in some way (not necessarily monetarily) from telling their stories, not that we should ignore the price they paid as a victim.

But meanwhile the accused will be effected negatively, on a scale we can't even measure accurately. Even without proof or a formal trial, Trump already has suffered in the polls (source: [The Hill](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/300613-trump-loses-lead-in-only-major-national-poll-showing-him)) and his brand will likely suffer as well.

Can the system afford for these ""he said/she said"" affairs to ""go nowhere"", as you say?",I ment going nowhere on a legal standpoint.

"C: Women who accuse men of sexual assault, particularly powerful men, are almost always subject to character assassination.  The Bill Cosby case is a particularly strong example - it wasn't until Hannibal Buress mentioned Cosby's history during a stand-up set that most people believed the accusations against him.  And the previous lawsuits had been VERY public.","The key word there is *powerful* men. When the accused man isn't powerful, the reverse is often true from what I have seen. Elevatorgate is a classic example and its inciting incident was nothing compared to the accusations against Trump or Bill Clinton. It's not the only such incident.

I think that the differentiating factor is that a powerful person's reputation can take a hit and bounce back on the strength of the other things people remember them for. They are also more able to effect a character assassination of their opponent either directly or—more commonly, in my opinion—as a side-effect of their fans' unwillingness to look at the evidence and admit that their hero could have done something awful.

As far as what happens to victims who take the stand in a trial, the fact is that testimony, even—perhaps especially—victim testimony should not be taken at face value. Memories are notoriously inaccurate and people may speak untruths without any intention of lying. This is even more the case when the situation is a traumatic or emotionally-charged one or when one's reputation is very publicly at stake. And deliberate lying isn't exactly unheard of either. So some attempt to tease the closest thing to a true account out of a witness seems extremely advisable, since courts are supposed to be about establishing truth and using that truth to render a verdict. Nonetheless, I think that courts can do a great deal more to become less traumatic, especially to victim witnesses, mostly by moving away to some degree from the adversarial system that exists now. It seems like counsel is incentivized to use bad logical arguments, emotional appeals, and a variety of other non-rational rhetorical techniques, some of which can be hurtful to innocent witnesses and none of which reliably advance toward a true verdict.",3423,6,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

The reason why I think people hone in on this aspect in sexual assault is a little bit that sex, by virtue of its intimacy, is less likely to have another witness, but we also don't want a system where lack of witnesses suffocates the crime. Another hurdle is simply that everybody has sex and, unlike other crimes like murder or theft, can envision themselves in the compromising position of being that criminal defendant.","Even more complicating here is that the ""he-said"" in these specific cases are [denials of the ""she said""](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html) while the general ""he-said"" [actually confirms](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOh9C1vdjPAhVGMyYKHSSsBqkQtwIIJzAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2Fvideos%2Fpolitics%2F2016%2F10%2F07%2Fdonald-trump-women-lewd-comments-origwx-cs.cnn&amp;usg=AFQjCNEw5N253Jj0GaLK5Wa9Q7rAx4xr3A&amp;sig2=cUHHhnPqN1xTnn6whL3t5Q) the veracity of the ""she-said"" claims.

"A: Off the top of my head, here are a few reasons

1) There is a big difference between saying you can do something and actually doing it.

2) It is fairly prejudicial from a legal standpoint at least to use a general statement as proof of a specific incident. Showing someone said ""I love doing drugs"" is not proof of a specific instance of doing cocaine.

3) what you are trying to pull from his statement (and pattern of behavior) is in a sense bad character evidence (the inference that he is the type of guy to do X). Legally speaking, this inference is generally more prejudicial than probative and not permitted.

4) owing to the current timing, it is very difficult to distinguish political attack from valid allegation.

5) in a sense, the witnesses/accusers have been affected by the media publication of this video and can very likely be cognitively biased; fitting their experiences to the narrative. This retroactive memory is a common issue

It is perhaps fair to say there is smoke, but not even a single instance has been proven; thus the evidence is hardly dispositive.","&gt; 2) It is fairly prejudicial from a legal standpoint at least to use a general statement as proof of a specific incident. Showing someone said ""I love doing drugs"" is not proof of a specific instance of doing cocaine.

I think your points are fair, but if someone says to you 'I love doing cocaine' and then another friend says 'Yeah, I saw him doing cocaine once', surely the initial statement makes you far more likely to believe he's telling the truth. Yes, it's still not proven 100% and in a court system it's not proof, but for the person on the street considering whether to vote for someone if someone says he sexually assaults women and then 10 women claim he sexually assaulted them, surely it's reasonable to assume that some sexual assault did happen and that would affect your vote (potentially).

These women only came forward *after* the media report; they can not really be said to be *independent* corroborators.

See this article for how easily false memories (especially dating back so far) form: https://faculty.washington.edu/eloftus/Articles/sciam.htm

It is easy to see how the power of suggestion via the media narrative of Trump can inform one's memory.

He's bragging, so it's possible he's exaggerating, but it is by the plain meaning of the words an admittance.

"B: There are two different ways Mr. Trump could be ""punished"" if these accusations are found valid.  There are punishments handed out by the government (criminal prosecution) and there are negative effects on his Presidential campaign.    Whether the government can prosecute Mr. Trump is a different question from whether public opinion can turn against him.  Public opinion has no statute of limitations, there is no burden of proof, and there are no rules about what evidence the public accepts when casting their Presidential vote.  It is up to each person to weigh the evidence themselves and react accordingly.

What would happen legally if charges are filed is a different question.  AKA whether Trump can be prosecuted by the government.  The statute of limitations on sex based crimes varies state by state.  You can find individual statutes of limitations for each state here: (https://victimsofcrime.org/docs/DNA%20Resource%20Center/sol-for-sexual-assault-check-chart---final---copy.pdf?sfvrsn=2).  

In the United States, the standard for conviction of a criminal defendant is beyond a reasonable doubt.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt#United_States).  Rules of evidence are complicated (and again vary by state to state), but the weight and value of any admitted evidnece would be the discretion of the jury to decide.

The article you cited does not relate to Trump.  The standard for sexual assaults on campus (and a school imposing sanctions) is different than someone charged criminally (and being punished by jail time).  As nicely summarized : There is a huge difference between the standard of proof required for any criminal court in the United States versus what is required in an on-campus sexual assault case. In any criminal court in the United States the standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. What that means is that the government has to prove their case in criminal court beyond any reasonable doubt.  http://criminallawdc.com/standards-for-evidence-in-dc-campus-sex-crimes-cases.html

I don't think these are going to be prosecuted crimes - the Clinton items were never able to be prosecuted and I doubt that anything will come out that can be held against Trump legally. 

As for the libel case, there is a reason that the news papers haven't reported as many women as have come forward. In the case of the photographer who works for People, after the incident happened she requested to be pulled off of her Trump assignment. Presumably they would have that in their HR records. When you see it coming out in major publications you can bet their lawyers have already reviewed it for libel. Further I think that Trump would have to [prove their claims to be false](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/defamation-law-made-simple-29718.html). Given that, as others have mentioned, much of it comes down to he-said-she-said, its hard to prove that its false. And most of the people who have  been *published* can prove that they were with Trump at the time they are saying it occurred. 

Also, speaking neutrally, I think its odd to call Bill Clinton a ""known-philanderer"" and not Donald Trump. 

Edit: Also, per the [NYT response letter to Trump](https://twitter.com/MarkHarrisNYC/status/786620581261127680), nothing they are publishing is damaging to his character, because it is all in line with the reputation he has cultivated through his discussions with Howard Stern, and his released tape. An excerpt from their letter: 

&gt;The essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of one's reputation. Mr. Trump has bragged about his non-consensual sexual touching of women. He has bragged about intruding on beauty pageant contestants in their dressing rooms. He has acquiesced to a radio host's request to discuss Mr. Trump's own daughter as a ""piece of ass."" ...Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself.","&gt;why the spouse of a presidential candidate doing something

This is not the argument being made by ""legitimate"" Trump surrogates. Yes there are a lot of people using ""Bill Clinton's a rapist"" as an attack against Hillary (eg. just search for `bill clinton rape` on the_donald), but the actual argument being made by Trump's campaign isn't against Bill's actions it's against Hillary's reaction to what Bill (allegedly) did.  For example, from Kellyanne Conway:

&gt;But Conway said the decision to bring the four women, three of whom claim to have been the victim of rape or unwanted sexual advances by Bill Clinton, was not meant to equate Trump’s words with the Clintons’ supposed deeds. 

&gt;“Let's not conflate the two. This does not have to do with Bill Clinton. It has to do with the way Hillary Clinton shamed and blamed the women in Bill Clinton’s life,”

"A: True but considering the circumstances, I would expect someone to stick with their spouse. At the time they were baseless accusations that fell apart upon scrutiny.

From this article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/13/donald-trump-is-threatening-to-sue-the-new-york-times-that-might-be-a-bad-idea/

&gt;Winning a libel case is inherently difficult for a public figure such as Trump. The Legal Information Institute at Cornell University Law School provides a helpful explanation of the hurdles Trump would have to clear:

&gt;To win a defamation case, a plaintiff must show four things: 1) a false statement purporting to be fact; 2) publication or communication of that statement to a third person; 3) fault; and 4) damages, or some harm caused to the person or entity who is the subject of the statement.

&gt;Since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1964 decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, defamation claims have been limited by First Amendment concerns. Thus, for instance, public officials and public figures (people who are famous) must show that statements were made with actual malice to recover in an action for defamation. Actual malice means that a statement was made with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether or not it was false. In addition, a plaintiff must show actual malice by ""clear and convincing"" evidence rather than the usual burden of proof in a civil case, preponderance of the evidence.",3423,73,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

From this article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/13/donald-trump-is-threatening-to-sue-the-new-york-times-that-might-be-a-bad-idea/

&gt;Winning a libel case is inherently difficult for a public figure such as Trump. The Legal Information Institute at Cornell University Law School provides a helpful explanation of the hurdles Trump would have to clear:

&gt;To win a defamation case, a plaintiff must show four things: 1) a false statement purporting to be fact; 2) publication or communication of that statement to a third person; 3) fault; and 4) damages, or some harm caused to the person or entity who is the subject of the statement.

&gt;Since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1964 decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, defamation claims have been limited by First Amendment concerns. Thus, for instance, public officials and public figures (people who are famous) must show that statements were made with actual malice to recover in an action for defamation. Actual malice means that a statement was made with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether or not it was false. In addition, a plaintiff must show actual malice by ""clear and convincing"" evidence rather than the usual burden of proof in a civil case, preponderance of the evidence.","Given how badly Trump wants to [rewrite libel laws](http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-libel-laws-sue-media-2016-2) in this country, I doubt a SCOTUS decision would stop him if he became president.",3423,74,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

I find that unlikely. It's not like there's just a few women who incidentally accused Bill Clinton once or twice.

The reality is that Bill Clinton has been plagued with accusations of unusual relationships, extra martial relationships, and abusive relationships - since before he was married to Hillary. 

&gt; [source](http://nation.foxnews.com/2015/12/29/millennials-guide-bill-clintons-20-sex-scandals) - In 1974, an unnamed University of Arkansas student complained to her faculty advisor that her law professor Bill Clinton groped her and forced his hand inside her blouse. The 28-year-old law professor claimed that she was the one who came onto him.

(they were married in 1975) - there was also another incident in 1972.

Importantly, more than one of Bill's accusers have said Hillary is directly involved with threatening the accusers to remain silent. [George Stephanopoulos](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/09/hillary-clinton-treated-bill-clintons-female-accusers-lewinsky-broaddrick-flowers-hamzy-stephanopoulos/) has said this. Gennifer Flowers is really the lynchpin in the argument here - Clinton said she would ""[crucify her](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/enabler-or-family-defender-how-hillary-clinton-responded-to-husbands-accusers/2016/09/28/58dad5d4-6fb1-11e6-8533-6b0b0ded0253_story.html)"" on the stand for lying - but then, what do you know - six years later Clinton is forced to admit he did have sexual relations with that woman - he was fucking her for *12 years.* There's no way Hillary didn't know.

So, Clinton is either the single stupidest women in history - or, as many familiar with have said - she's actively involved in shielding her husband.","&gt;  Now you could argue Bill used his power of office to get Monica to do what she did. 

You do realize that no one is accusing Bill Clinton of abusing Monica Lewenski. AFAIK, that relationship was consensual.

This is revealing because these accusations of sexual assault were either 1) discovered after the DNC complied their opposition files, 2) the accusers were collected by an external group outside of the DNC, blindsiding the DNC, 3) these accusations are baseless, which is why they never appeared in the opposition file in the first place.",3423,102,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

At that point, the fact that such a big name as Rolling Stone reporting these allegations was perceived as a proof that it happened, before getting under heavy scrutiny by sceptics. People usually trust the claim without proof if it is something they want to be the truth.
 
I personally cannot take any allegations that are done this close to election as seriously as they perhaps should, it's just too fitting time for them to rise.

I always remind myself that if I don't actually have anything personally to add to a story or outcry and if I don't already know what's real or not, that it's best to set your outputs aside and allow the story to unfold itself. The world's a big place and people as front and center as Bill and Donald are not going to be overlooked. Outside of people in positions to dig through exclusive information or make unique observations, no single individual is going to be filling a blind spot like a thumb in a dam.

When you're unsure of how to react, distill the situation into a set of branching understandings. If an accusation *is* true, ask yourself how you should react to it. If it *isn't* true, construct a second understanding and hold onto it as well. These represent the committed emotional thrusts against the grain of neutral reasoning. If your goal is to remain neutral, use these branches to remain conscious of your words.

When I'm stuck trying to express myself and desperately trying to avoid casting blame one way or another, I focus more on explaining to others why it's important for me to know more.

There is less investment in the carbon energy market on a global scale, and this is causing Russia to find buyers for its vast supplies of natural gas and oil. With Ukraine economically destabilized, and what appears to be a political destabilization as well (see the Russian land grab in eastern Ukraine), Russia may not come on top with a buyer for its resources. However, if turkey gains control of Syria, it's going to be an economic boon for Russia's carbon energy market, which might be able to keep them afloat to realign with the global energy trend. The motive for Russia, if not directly, then indirectly using subversion, to perform acts to destabilize the area is there.

Again, the early facts point to the fact that the chemicals were supplied by a state actor of some kind, with motive and target pointing at Assad, but could also be linked to Russia.

It's safe to say that the free Syrian army has access to the same weapons that the Syrian army had based on this fact.

3. The assertion that Russia is trying to destabilize Syria using Turkey as s proxy is very wrong, but there is some truth here: I think Turkey is at this alone, there are sources that state that turkey provided chemicals weapons to rebels ([source 1](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/isis-obtained-materials-chemical-weapons-7020810), [source 2](https://www.rt.com/news/335069-kurds-turkey-syria-rebels-sarin/)) and the town is 50km from Turkey, there are also sources that state that Turkey has used chemical weapons on Kurdish rebels in Turkey ([Source 1](http://dailycaller.com/2016/08/25/us-backed-kurdish-militias-say-they-were-gassed-by-turkish-forces/), [Source 2](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/shocking-images-of-dead-kurdish-fighters-turkey-accused-of-using-chemical-weapons-against-pkk-a-711536.html)).

Also, the PKK aren't active in Syria. The Kurdish fighters in Syria are the YPG (People's Protection Units). They are usually neutral in the Syrian conflict, though they sometimes cooperate with Syrian government forces e.g. the YPG collaborated with Syrian government forces when fighting against rebels in Aleppo city last year near the Kurdish suburb of Sheikh Masood. 

Assad's government are fighting a Sunni Arab insurgency, mostly composed of Islamist and jihadist rebel groups.

Trump keeps talking about ISIS in terms of hitting them at their economic well-being...well Russia has been hit precisely by that method over the past several years.

It's as deplorable as anything one would expect in a war.  What makes CBR usage so dangerous for the West is that it's inherently asymmetrical - it's the weapon of choice for small, undeveloped regimes to challenge the West.  They convey enormous power advantages for a small cost.

&gt;The parent commenter seems to think that its usage insofar has not seemed to be of any added benefit to him.

It depends upon the manner of usage.  Chemical weapons in a large-scale war like the [Iran-Iraq war](http://www.history.com/topics/iran-iraq-war) can literally halt the human wave tactics the Iranians deployed against Iraq.  Iran is much larger country and asymmetrical tactics like chemical weapons allowed for Iraq to survive the war intact.

These are countries representing themselves in the UN, not the UN itself. Yes there are a lot of Asian allies that shun the idea of disarmament because of US influence. Their influence probably also helps enforce the chemical weapons ban. But the United Nations purposely tries to propose disarmament, such as with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. To show that they do actively support developing countries, particularly in industry as you requested I cite, just look at the stated goal of the UN's Industrial Development Organization:

""In developing countries the private sector mainly consists of micro, small and medium enterprises that generate a large share of employment and income opportunities. Often, however, their development potential remains untapped, as firms operate in isolation, are locked into uncompetitive production patterns and unable to approach dynamic business partners that could bring in new expertise and know how.

UNIDO aims to boost the development of a competitive private sector and contribute to poverty reduction by building sustainable linkages between small-size enterprises, their larger scale business partners and support institutions.

Linkages enhance enterprise competitiveness through the realization of economies of scale and scope and are a source of sustainability, as they increase the capacity of the economic actors to collectively react to crisis and turning points. Linkages also pave the way for broad-based and inclusive development, where poor entrepreneurs and workers participate in economic activities on fair terms.""



It entirely focuses on domestic industries within developing countries, and how fair practices and ""bringing in expertise"" can boost economic *competitiveness*. That means not letting bigger powers plunder smaller ones' resources like in the past, but promoting those countries growth so that they're economically competitive against larger ones. To see how them and other agencies do that, its easy to peruse the many financial development programs the UN does. They all follow under this model, not toward the benefit of highly developed countries' foreign direct investment. Their focus on environmentalism in this regard also contests the idea of pandering to constituencies, given the influential affect corporations have in such circumstances.

Thus, due to the sheer danger of that war, powers were attached to it that gave the executive phenomenal amounts of power and authority, as it was seen that a reaction time in minutes was likely to be necessary along with the threat of nuclear attack on US territory needing quick and decisive action to mitigate it as well as in the aftermath and reclamation/recovery period.

That legislation is still the same today. And I would hope you'd agree that war with Iraq or Afganistan doesn't remotely require the breadth of powers that a WW3 with the Soviet Union would have needed.

Thus, the question is the legislation itself and why it hasn't been amended now that the threat isn't so severe. A contingency, in case it is needed thus Congress and the President developed work around? Laziness/apathy, legislators not wanting to spent their political power and time and effort on something that that isn't going to benefit them or their constituents directly thus making reelection less easy?

&gt; Q    Can I follow up, sir?  Last year, you seemed to be reluctant to get involved -- or to intervene in Syria directly.  Is that one thing that’s changed after yesterday?

&gt;PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, one of the things I think you’ve noticed about me is, militarily, I don’t like to say where I’m going and what I doing.  And I watched past administrations say, we will attack at such and such a day at such and such an hour.  And you, being a warrior -- you would say, why are they saying that?  And I’m sure you sat back in Jordan, and you said, why are they saying that?

&gt;I watched Mosul, where the past administration was saying, we will be attacking in four months.  And I said, why are they doing that?  Then a month goes by, and they say, we will be attacking in three months, and then two months, and then we will be attacking next week.  And I’m saying, why are they doing that?  And as you know, Mosul turned out to be a much harder fight than anyone thought, and a lot of people have been lost in that fight.

&gt;I’m not saying I’m doing anything one way or the other, but I’m certainly not going to be telling you, as much as I respect you, John.  Thank you.

Also, so much information has been found with the Mueller probe.  What has made it to the press is often months behind where Mueller's team actually is.

And by the way, Obama did nothing with any of this knowledge from his alleged “spy”. And yet his FBI director went against DOJ policy to publicly reprimand Hillary and announce a reopening of Hillary’s criminal investigation a week before the election.

Remember Trump even said Comey’s public statements on Hillary were improper.

"B: I too would like to respond to **Deleted Commenter**, but instead will just post this here:

Trump is decisively not right, as can be seen from the linked [Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/may/21/stefan-halper-fbi-informant-revelation-underscores/) article which, despite its pro-trump stance, does not say that there was a spy in Trump's campaign.

For Trump's statement to be true, three things would have to be true:

1. The informant was a ""spy,""
2. The informant was ""in the Trump campaign,"" and
3. The use of an informant in the Trump campaign undermines the ""authenticity"" or legitimacy of the special investigation.

Number 1 is easiest to substantiate, because there are a lot of different definitions of ""spy."" He was a clandestine informant, so that's probably good enough for most. ""Informant"" is definitely more apt, since he wasn't committing any crime, e.g. espionage.

Number 2 seems roundly false. There is no indication that he was in Trump's campaign in any sense.

Number 3 is subjective, but also seems nearly certain to be untrue. How would actions taken before Rosenstein or Mueller were appointed undermine their authority to investigate?

"B: &gt; Does it undermine Mueller's authority? I would think so.

I just want to point out that you're using ""authority"" here in terms of popular sentiment and not juridico-legal authority. That's not wrong, necessarily, as democratic authority issues in part from public sentiment. It's not the same, though, as juridico-legal authority. Nothing I've seen would suggest that Mueller's legal authority to conduct the investigation has in any way been compromised by this.

Note: a great deal of scholarship has gone to criticizing the degree to which public sentiment can or should influence otherwise juridical forms of political authority and decision-making in democracy. The most famous is Walter Lippmann's [Public Opinion (pdf warning)](http://wps.pearsoncustom.com/wps/media/objects/2429/2487430/pdfs/lippmann.pdf).

The western world has devalued males. For instance, rape laws have changed to the point that men are assumed guilty, until proven innocent. If a 13 yr old girl claims a man rapes her, the man can be thrown in prison without any real evidence. He will get prison time, and then have his entire life ruined by an accusation.

I completely disagree with that. In my mind, the only difference between belief in God and belief in a tooth fairy are the large number of people who believe it and the fact that people have believed in gods for ages. However, according to this same article those are respectively an ""appeal to popularity"" and an ""appeal to tradition"" and therefore not valid as arguments.

"B: &gt;By the way, I find it amusing that you compare belief in a god to belief in bigfoot or the tooth fairy, because that is apparently an ""appeal to ridicule"".

You are correct that comparing faith in God to the belief in the Tooth Fairy is an appeal to ridicule. I would argue that a comparison to belief in bigfoot is not though, as people do believe bigfoot is a real unknown animal.

But you either misread or misunderstood my comment; I never mentioned belief or faith.

","More important than the list of fallacies is being able to tell what causes a fallacy to be so problematic.  While this list is convenient and easy-to-view, it does not explain what causes these fallacies to be so problematic.  Using fallacies on their own without an understanding of what causes them to be problematic is, in effect, explaining by naming (a fallacy).   So below I will explain what about fallacies is so problematic in case people reading here are not as intimately familiar with critical thinking as I have been.

All fallacies are, at their root, questionable assumptions without apparent justification that we use so regularly that we decide to name them.  Every argument (by this term, I mean ""a conclusion and the reasons leading to it"") contains crucial assumptions, but not every assumption is questionable.  For instance, if I were to argue that the Sun is hurting my eyes when I stare at it, one assumption being made is that the Sun is an object capable of causing other objects harm without directly touching those other objects.  But is it really a questionable assumption that the Sun can be an object that directly causes pain?

Some arguments do contain questionable assumptions though--in fact, most arguments do.  In economics, many economists argue that the idea market system is the competitive market.  Democratic-leaning economists (so talking U.S.) tend to argue that the government has a role in guiding markets to be more competitive and republicans typically argue that these markets work best without governments distorting them.  

Each side of the above example contains questionable assumptions about the nature of competitive markets, as well as about human nature (the behavior of which is what economics is attempting to predict).  They probably contain other assumptions which bright people (see also: smartasses) tackle on a regular basis in exhausting detail.  That's why everyone hates those guys.

Fallacies are those questionable assumptions that we make so regularly that we have created names for them.  The Ad Hoc fallacy (latin for ""and this"") is for when someone works so visibly hard to maintain a conclusion by repeatedly  explaining away the counter-evidence to that conclusion.  You can think of the Chinese lady in Dumb and dumber that keeps saying ""And then...?""  The reason why it is a fallacy is because the person explaining away each new piece of counter-evidence continues to assume that the stated conclusion and the counter-evidence (which, by definition, conflicts with the reasons and/or evidence for the conclusion) do not conflict.  There is an inherent disconnect that needs to be explained.

(Why should you trust anything I just said?  It is time for one of those lovely appeals to authority.  Hopefully, however, you'll be able to determine whether I am a questionable authority about the topic at hand.  I have helped substantially revise a Critical thinking textbook that is regularly used throughout the country.  How regularly?  I don't know, the authors don't tell me how many copies sold to how many universities.  I was specifically responsible for crafting examples in each chapter for the varying topics of those chapters.  I might not be much of an authority, but at least I told you.  What other authorities have you trusted have informed you of THEIR experience?)",7115,7,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"B: Buckyeye's definition of ad hoc isn't as clear as it could be.   
Here's an example of ad hoc used by ""A"".

    A: ""I had cancer and I prayed for it to go away and it did. I was healed from cancer by God!""  
    B: ""Really? Why doesn't god heal others with cancer?""  
    A: ""Maybe they don't pray.""  
    B: ""A lot of them do. My aunt died from cancer and she prayed for it to go away every day.""  
    A: ""Well...God works in mysterious ways."" (ad hoc)

As ""A"" is being refuted by ""B"" he comes up with a special case (ad hoc) for how he is correct.

If the evidence and the conclusion do not conflict, there should be reasoning for why that is the case.  For instance, suppose that some Young Earth Creationists argue that things are so complex that geological for how things became the way they are is untenable (things like ""how can you explain the complexity of a watch without assuming a [watchmaker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker_analogy)?"").  

In effect, these YECs are arguing that geologists' explanation for how the earth formed fails to explain how complex things existed because ""all complex things require an intelligent designer.""  There are several ways to point out logical missteps in that reasoning, but let's take the most respectful approach and say that the base assumption that the YECs are using is questionable.  By using the questionable assumption as the foundation for the counter-evidence, the YECs have given the pro-geology argument a free pass: ""Your counter-evidence fails to be compelling because it uses a highly questionable assumption in assuming that all things must be created by an intelligent designer when that is not necessarily the case.""

In other words, what might seem to be an ad hoc fallacy is not at all problematic because the questionable assumption is defensible (and regularly is defended).

But let's reverse the example.  Suppose we're focused on the YEC.  Someone presents the YEC with a combination of chemistry knowledge of how things work today, geological evidence using that knowledge of chemistry, and many very very old things.  The YEC explains this evidence by claiming it was all in God's plan.  A nifty catch-all, no?  More and more counter-evidence for the base claim that the world is 6,000 years old mounts, and YECs continue to explain it away by assuming their base assumption is true--which in turn explains why the counter-evidence is false.  THIS is an ad hoc fallacy in that it contains the assumption that the conclusion and the counter-evidence do not conflict.  Why don't they conflict?

What thoughts do you have on this? ","I'm also exmuslim so I can offer my thoughts. 

It's less that Islam is protected and more of  a misguided attempt by some people (mostly on the left) to shield Muslims from what they perceive are attacks. Many of them go overboard and end up defending the ideology instead of just the people. Many use the whataboutism fallacy like you said. Many can't even tell the difference between Islam and a Muslim - see people who think mockery or criticism of the religion is bigotry/racism.

The attitude is really worrisome imo. It reinforces the idea among many (including Muslims) that attacks on Islam are also attacks on Muslims. This is why criticism of Muhammad is in such a bizarre place, I've seen people being accused of Islamophobia *simply for reading aloud things that Muhammad did from the scripture itself*. 

I ultimately chalk it up to the Left trying to be sympathetic and viewing Muslims as an oppressed minority. You'll still find many who insist they dislike Islam but think not all Muslims should be judged by it, and of course they're thinking of bigots who call all Muslims terrorists when they say that. 

But stifling discourse just because you're afraid the lowest common denominator will misinterpret what you're saying is frankly myopic and idiotic on so many levels imo.

As reformers like Maajid Nawaz or Irshad Manji would say, the unsavory parts of Islam need to be discussed in the open. We don't need people insisting they don't exist, or that no one (or only a tiny minority) believes in it. If you can't even reach this first part, the path to reform, Enlightenment, etc is impossible. E.g. You can't 'reform' and water down the character of Muhammad if you don't even admit there are things in scripture about him that are pretty backwards. ",12695,43,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

I want to know the standards they go by as well, but the fact that none have been denied might be due to the NSA knowing exactly what they need to have before hand. They may only be going for sure bet warrents, but without further information its all speculation sadly.

Not the best reason, but now that this information is out, the people the NSA may be targeting are aware of it they may be more cautious with their communications from here own out.

However, I agree with you to a large extent, this psychology quirk can not be counted on in the long run. All that said, eventually this will fall apart. In time people will adapt to the status quo.

"A: It's pretty interesting seeing how people have reacted to TPP with time. A lot of the talking points seem really menacing to everyday folks (i.e. ISDS court), but becomes much less threatening when explained.

","1. Being the big fish in a trade agreement has geopolitical advantages. Instead of threatening countries with costly military action, you can just use sanctions. This becomes more true in our modern age where militarism and civilian casualties are a much bigger concern than they were in the past. Warfare is (and is becoming) much less explicit than in the past. It's about plausible deniability and economic warfare at this point.

2. Building on point 1, this also strengthens the cooperation between countries. China and the US are basically competing to add people to their economic coalitions. Since China is a big country, the only way to offset that power (assuming you even feel the need to offset that power is necessary) is to build a coalition of smaller countries. Up until recently these smaller countries like Vietnam, Korea, Japan, Phillipines, etc. were all fighting each other which made it easier for China to divide and conquer.

3. Chinese labor costs are rising quick, and Western countries need more sources of cheap labor. Trade and development deals can provide this cheap labor. And when those countries are developed in a few decades, the focus will shift to Africa. There is never an end to this until the whole world is developed.

4. This will be bad for many low to mid level US workers because more industries and businesses will move some operations overseas (or not move them back since Chinese labor costs are up). At first, just the manufacturing is moved and US companies have to babysit these factories to make sure the quality and logistics are there. Later, the factories become more self-sufficient and start to reproduce existing Western products on their own accord, which they then sell to Western companies. Western companies like this because the risk and investment is less for them. Even later, these Chinese companies start to innovate and then skip the Western companies entirely and start to directly market to Western consumers. We are not to that stage yet.

5. Costs will decrease or at least not increase as much as they otherwise would have, and there will eventually be more competition and interesting products on the market.

"B: From Kevin Carson's [At Reason, War is Peace … and TPP is “Free Trade”](https://c4ss.org/content/41012):

&gt; . . . such agreements are the direct opposite of free trade. They create a net increase in protectionism. The reduction of tariffs and other barriers to the movement of goods across national borders is only secondary, if not incidental. Their purpose, rather, is to drastically increase the form of protectionism most central to the dominant corporate business model today: So-called “intellectual property.” The draconian IP provisions of contemporary “free trade” treaties serve the interests of global corporations the same way high industrial tariffs served American corporations a century ago.

&gt; . . .

&gt; These treaties, by facilitating the movement of means of production across borders, enable corporations to contract production to independent sweatshops in low wage countries, pay them $2 for a pair of sneakers, and import them for sale at Walmart for $200. And because patents and trademarks give them a monopoly on sale of the product, they’re protected against the independent contractors deciding to produce identical shoes and selling them for $10 on the local market.

&gt; In the early 20th century, when most industrial capital was national, Western countries’ main imports were raw materials from the colonial world and their main exports were finished industrial goods. So it was in the interest of American manufacturers to restrict competition in the domestic market from imported goods manufactured in other industrialized countries. Fast forward 100 years though, and most American imports are by the Western-owned global corporations themselves, importing goods produced under contract for them so they can sell them in the domestic market at an enormous “intellectual property” markup over the cost of production.

&gt; Since the movement of goods across borders is now mostly an internal affair of global corporations themselves, outmoded tariffs that impede the movement of goods have become an inconvenience. What they need, instead, is a form of protectionism that still gives them a monopoly over selling a particular product in a particular market — but operates at corporate boundaries rather than national ones. That’s what “intellectual property” does.

&gt; . . .

&gt; So what’s falsely called “free trade” today isn’t a decrease in protectionism. It’s a shift from one kind of protectionism that no longer serves corporate interests, to a new kind of protectionism that better serves them.",Thanks,11756,83,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

"C: The question about Trump's spending is pretty clearly tied to government activity.  It's asking how much money the government is spending on something.  And questions about government activity are properly classified as political.

There are many climate related questions which could be political questions.  For instance:

* Is a carbon tax an effective tool for fighting climate change?

* What sort of treaty protocols could enforce global agreements on emissions?

* What regulations have been particularly effective or ineffective relating to climate change?

* Is the US government's stance on climate change scientifically justified?

The thing of those examples is that they directly tie climate change to particular government action of some sort, which makes them political questions.  

Your question is purely asking about scientific consensus, with really no tie to government or policy.

There are also some other rules your post breaks in as much as it tries to exclude certain answers or paths of discussion, which violates our rules around neutral framing.  But those could be fixed.  The reason I gave it the rejection reason I did was that the issue of not being a political question did not seem fixable while still asking the question you wanted to ask.","Hmm... Ok, what about the following (I have removed my citations for this draft) : 

Title: Is the US government's stance on climate change scientifically justified?

The right has been categorized for some time as totally denying climate change. However, there are arguments that recognize human-generated rising CO2 levels, their greenhouse effect, and the fact that this has led to increases in global temperatures, but also state that even if unchecked, we have little reason to believe that this poses a serious or even mild threat. This argument has existed in the 'alt right', if you will, as far back as 2009.

On the other hand, Obama famously remarked that 97% of climate scientists agree in human-made global warming, a claim that, though debated, seems well supported based on some quick googling 12. It also seems to me like a relatively uncontroversial claim. However, in demonstrating that this is a call to action, his implication is that these same climate scientists believe that this warming will continue, and that this will pose a serious environmental problems, an idea that is challenged by some more-reasonable conservative sources 34. I am therefore curious if 97%...or some high percentage of climate scientists would agree that there is reasonable certainty that unchecked global warming is a grave environmental threat in the near term (&lt;50-100 years)? That is, is there indeed scientific justification for major climate action?? Does anyone have a sense on what the field thinks with respect to the confidence that we can assign to the predictions of climate models, what these climate models suggest in the aggregate, and how well they have performed thus far?

Additionally, in science I recognize that there are biases that can encourage cherry-picking data, or shaping papers in particular ways, or, in extreme circumstances, forging or explicitly lying about observations or conclusions. These biases clearly exist, and are championed by the right as examples of a systematic global manipulation i the field of climate science to push a narrative of catastrophe. On the other hand, people in climate science have devoted their lives to understanding these phenomena, are uniquely qualified to offer opinions on future projections, and to imagine they are systematically politically persuaded on a global scale to lie for political or funding purposes seems hyperbolic.  (It might be of interest to note the recent high-profile science paper's climate data controversey ).

So does anyone have any insight? Anyone worked for a substantial amount of time in climate science to be able to personally vouch for confidence (or lack thereof) in our climate models in predicting trends accurately, and hence in the left's agenda for climate action justified? Or if other mechanisms like carbon sequestration may render a saturation of CO2 levels in the near-term? (this is the only mechanism I can come up with off the top of my head that might be reasonable explanation for global warming not meaningfully continuing, but I assume other's know way more about this than I). And perhaps more importantly, is there any good reason why the scientific justification is not articulated in a very public way to the point where this shouldn't really be a discussion?

There are basically 3 tracks for immigration. The first is refugees and it is the one that actually tend to be the largest in recent years, the second is skilled labor (doctors, scientists, engineers, etc), and the third is unskilled labor (manual labor, janitors, etc). There are a limited number of slots given for each of these and once they are filled no more can immigrate that year. This is because we as a nation have a finite number of jobs and resources with which to care for our existing citizenry and in order to do it's job of protecting that citizenry they must limit how many new immigrants are competing for the resources. 

The type of government you are describing as having free immigrant travel across all borders can only exist in science fiction currently because it takes a single global government for that to function. Until such time as that happens there will be immigration and laws regulating it. Until such time you will also have those who break the laws and they should be punished just like anyone who breaks the law should.

I want to follow up on this point, as I think it illustrates a general fallacy in preventing bad behavior. 

Let's say that Action X is considered ""bad"" in our country. Joe Schmo comes from a culture where Action X is tolerated, perhaps even encouraged. Citizen **scashman** says, ""I hate Action X, and I don't want people who tolerate Action X to be admitted to this country.""

Of the two options -- allowing Joe Schmo to immigrate, or preventing Joe Schmo from immigrating, which option is likely to result in *less incidence of Action X*?

I argue that allowing immigration will reduce the frequency of Action X. Going from a culture that tolerates or encourages Action X, to one that does not, will put negative peer pressure on Joe to change his ways. Indeed, we may have more incidents of Action X within our borders, but the absolute total frequency of Action X among all potential actors is certain to go down.

I'd posit that this is equivalent to the following:  Would you treat a stranger and a close friend or family member _exactly_ the same if they wanted to crash on your couch and borrow 100 dollars?  Arguably it _is_ the ethical thing to do, but if you understand why you would not do this, you understand why nation states do not treat citizens and non-citizens equally.  You have a relationship with friends or family, a network of social obligations, and some expectation of getting reciprocity.  You _know_ them.  People are not perfectly ethical, so they don't always turn the other cheek and go the extra mile.

So how is discriminating by race different than the above?  It's different because it's _stupid_.  You might reasonably extend couch crashing priveleges to people you know, but would you only let people with names starting with the letter T crash on your couch and no one else?

Look, there's a strong moral argument to be made that you ought to treat everyone the same regardless of their first initial, relationship to you, race, or nationality.  Most of the Gospels and a number of other works are centered on trying to get people to do exactly this.  But if you want to understand why people do what they do, rather than understand what they _would_ do if they were perfect, you should understand that what people consider the appropriate thing to do involves a mix of moral and practical justifications, judgements of what constitutes an important social grouping, and many other factors.  

And this brings up a second set of questions which I honestly don't know the answer to:  Is it right to expect other people to be perfectly moral?

Am I justified in judging someone because they don't live up to an ethical standard I myself cannot match?  And how hard should I strive to match it?

The New England colonies were fairly unique in that they consisted of relatively large numbers of individuals attempting to build a society who were not planning on going back to Europe. These colonies wound up being much less dependent upon their European home country than most other colonies.

The result was a society which resembled Europe, specifically England which was at the forefront of the growth of industrialism and the tradition of the rule of law, but did not have the history of strict feudal class divisions which would cause so many problems for Europe going into the nineteenth century.

America was largely influenced by [Natural Rights](http://www.law.columbia.edu/hamburger?exclusive=filemgr.download&amp;file_id=942328&amp;rtcontentdisposition=filename%3DNatural) although there [were a few different ideas on how to implement it](http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles2/contmodels.htm) the two main parties were the Federalist  and Anti-Federalists

[The Federalists](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/duel/peopleevents/pande05.html) were mainly identified with James Madison, John Jay and Alexander Hamilton these three men wrote [*The Federalist Papers*](http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fedpapers.html).  The Federalists argued for a stronger central government, and a fiscally sound government (strong central bank).  This was largely a party of businessmen.

[The Anti-Federalists](http://www.ushistory.org/us/16b.asp) also called The Democratic-Republican Party consisted of Patrick Henry and George Mason and Thomas Jefferson, who strongly opposed Hamilton's ideas (if you thought bad politics was a new thing in the US...it isn't).  They were afraid of the power of a central government and were primarily made up of independent frontiersmen.

&gt;“Our strategy is working,” said Army Colonel Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, who denied that Iraqi forces fled their positions as they did last year in the face of an Islamic State blitzkrieg in northern Iraq. The Islamic State “forces simply had the upper hand, and it was time for Iraqi forces to reposition,” he said.

&gt;“The president’s plan isn’t working,” Boehner told reporters. “It’s time for him to come up with a real, overarching strategy to defeat the ongoing terrorist threat.”

&gt;“This is a major setback, both for the Iraqi government and the U.S.,” retired Army General David Barno, the former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said of Ramadi’s capture. “It calls into question whether the Iraqi security forces can fight effectively.”

President Obama has stated that his goal in batteling ISIS is that ""[“We Will Degrade and Ultimately Destroy ISIL”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/10/president-obama-we-will-degrade-and-ultimately-destroy-isil)

&gt;The President reiterated that as Commander-in-Chief, his “highest priority is the security of the American people,” and noted that we have “consistently taken the fight to terrorists” that threaten the United States:

ISIS or ISIL or IS - depending on your desired nomenclature - invaded Iraq from Syria in 2014 after 3-4 years of gearing up. It seems to me that the Obama Administration's strategy on how to deal with ISIS has not changed in the last year and a half. What is the strategy? How will it result in the ""destruction"" of ISIS. During the Bush administration, it seemed very important for there to be benchmarks set to mark progress. Have benchmarks been set by the President or anyone else in the government? How well are those benchmarks being met?

I don't believe anyone wants ISIS to thrive and grow. However, the way in which we stop ISIS seems to me to have no consensus or clear outline of goals, or a way to achieve them. I'd love to hear from people who disagree and can outline the strategy for me.

EDIT: As a follow up question - Will the Obama administration be passing the presidency with the middle east (Syria, Iraq, Libya) looking the way it does today?

I'm not sure why you don't see it. You said they want them gone, are taking steps to make them go away, but don't want to be involved...

Now I agree with your assessment - they want them gone up to a point. They are willing to go so far to help ISIS get destroyed - but they won't go any further than that. This isn't a ""We will win at any cost"" situation. It is a ""I hope we can win if we make this bombing effort, but we aren't doing anything else.""

That is extremely contradictory.

&gt;The President has laid out his strategy;

I thought you just said he didn't have one - and that no one had one?

I agree with your summary of his strategy. It's part of that ""We will only go so far"" theory.

&gt;I just haven't heard anything that sounds comprehensive without basically boiling down to, ""Just go there and stay"" without any kind of timetable for withdrawal (or explicit mention that we should be a permanent occupying force).

I posed the very same questions about the President's strategy in this conversation. What is the time table for the bombing runs that we started oin ISIS back in 2014? When will these end? What is a metric for success? Clearly losing Rahmadi and having ISIS go door-to-door executing anyone in the Iraqi government isn't a good benchmark...

&gt;Yeesh.

Yeah. That's exactly how I feel about this too.

&gt;Maybe we can go into the weeds on it in a technical manner in it's own submission or something.

I did... maybe a year or more ago:

http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1lt6db/president_bush_acted_more_responsibly_in_iraq_and/","&gt; It is a ""I hope we can win if we make this bombing effort, but we aren't doing anything else.""

Right. Threading the needle between not trying to get overly involved while also achieving a secondary objective of aiding in the fall of ISIS. Not sure what is contradictory about that.

&gt; I thought you just said he didn't have one - and that no one had one?

I didn't say he didn't have a strategy. I said the administration doesn't want to be involved. Specifically, ""overly involved"". As you said, ""We will only go so far"". Limited force can be a strategy, especially in the larger view of strategy in the region.

What is being presented is a limited set of actions that balances not getting into another Iraq quagmire (even if you think that is an unfair assessment, surely you can imagine that is the mindset that is driving this approach) while also helping against extremists. So again, this has been presented. I'm not really clear on how it is his job to also provide a competing strategy to the one he presented. If he thought there was a better, different plan, he'd be executing/promoting it.

&gt; What is the time table for the bombing runs that we started oin ISIS back in 2014? When will these end? What is a metric for success?

This is a good point, and I think leads to my ultimate thoughts on the subject. I haven't seen a timetable or metric for success besides simple target elimination stats.

However, this isn't a bug its a feature, as they say. The real metric of success is working with the Iraqis and providing support to them. We are doing that. Putting boots on the ground puts way more of an imperative on us to provide details of objectives and timelines because we become a foreign occupying force and put many more of our troops in danger.

And simply, with air operations- we leave when we want to. If it isn't working, we can leave. If we hit some arbitrary goal, we fly away. Boots on the ground become more of an occupation, nation building, mission creep, vague operation. And the larger the force, the more this seems to be the case. This doesn't seem to be inherent to air vs. ground military operations, per se. But certainly seems to be the practical habits of these kinds of operations.

I suppose you could in theory propose some ""surge"" level operation that lasts 6 months explicitly, and try to avoid the occupation baggage. But that has its own problems, as well. And I'm not seeing anyone laying that out, so far.

&gt; Clearly losing Rahmadi and having ISIS go door-to-door executing anyone in the Iraqi government isn't a good benchmark...

As opposed to what? Sending in ""all the troops"" and sitting on Iraq until everyone plays nice? Again- for how long? What local leaders help without exacerbating Sunni vs. Shiite tensions? How do we know that things wont devolve yet again when we leave?

This is what I think is the elephant in the room that I haven't seem anyone at a high level seriously address: there are no good options. Even if you think the Iraq invasion was great or whatever... many, many people don't. When I talk about the ""official"" strategy vs. the implicit one is essentially what people have been pointing out for a long time: why can't the middle east take care of their own trash? We can help them, in appropriate ways and times. But trying to setup a new American state in the middle east by force just won't work. It seems that the only thing Sunni and Shia extremists *can* agree on is that they hate America and don't want us in the middle east.

They don't want us there and there isn't a clear path for America imposing peace upon the region by force. Its just that the American people can't handle that reality, so the government has to talk about ""targeted bombings"" to counterbalance what I feel is the larger strategy of limited engagement.",10253,27,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: &gt; Not sure what is contradictory about that.

I guess we will have to agree to disagree.

&gt;Limited force can be a strategy, especially in the larger view of strategy in the region.

Sure, not really trying but kind of trying is a strategy many people employ.

&gt;This is a good point, and I think leads to my ultimate thoughts on the subject. I haven't seen a timetable or metric for success besides simple target elimination stats.
&gt;However, this isn't a bug its a feature, as they say.

It's interesting you feel that way. Did you feel that way about the Bush Administration, or did you feel they needed time tables?

&gt;The real metric of success is working with the Iraqis and providing support to them. We are doing that.

Most reports say we are not doing that. Iran is.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/05/18/shiite-militias-assemble-ramadi/27521381/

&gt;Iran-backed Shiite militias mobilize to retake Iraq's Ramadi

You write:

&gt;Boots on the ground become more of an occupation, nation building, mission creep, vague operation.

And again, I am happy to disagree with you. This is a very clear mission. The vague mission is ""We want to destroy ISIS, we will bomb them, sometimes, and we promise not to ever put boots on the ground... But we will ""follow them to the gates of hell"" as the VP said.

&gt;As opposed to what? Sending in ""all the troops"" and sitting on Iraq until everyone plays nice? Again- for how long? 

Well, if we took action in 2011 when ISIS was becoming a threat rather than make fun of them and call them the JV team - it wouldn't be to this point. But yes - the only way to ""Destroy ISIS"" is to go destroy them. If we decide they are not really our enemy and they can build a base in Syria to train and arm and plan, then we shouldn't be suprised when 30,000 of the regions most battlehardened troops invade Iraq with some success.

Is the road harder now because of the last 6 years of foreign policy? You bet.

When does it end? It ends when ISIS no longer has safe havens to recruit and rearm and plot their attacks.

&gt;Even if you think the Iraq invasion was great or whatever

War isn't great. Anyone who has the perception that it is has never been anywhere near it. People shouldn't like it. But they shouldn't like what has been happening for the last 4+ years even more.

Do you know that the US bombed Libya for 10 months in 2011 until the government was destroyed? Or do you think we had nothing to do with that?

&gt;They don't want us there

The Iraqi government began begging for help the minute ISIS invaded.","&gt; Sure, not really trying but kind of trying is a strategy many people employ.

Limited, specific scope doesn't automatically equal not trying.

&gt; It's interesting you feel that way. Did you feel that way about the Bush Administration, or did you feel they needed time tables?

I felt they needed time tables, as I stated. Later on in my comment I explain how boots on the ground with a large force is different.

&gt; Most reports say we are not doing that. Iran is.

We are *both* doing that. Again, showing the Sunni vs. Shiite dynamics at play.

&gt; And again, I am happy to disagree with you. This is a very clear mission.

What was clear about the goals of the Iraq occupation? What was the win condition that allowed us to leave? The fall of Saddam's regime? Getting greeted as liberators and leaving before the year is out? Finding the weapons of mass destruction? Finding Saddam? Killing Saddam? Having a democratic election? The surge?

Consistently offering logistics and air support to friendly government forces for an extended period of time in conjunction with not giving up on effective global counter-terrorist operations for the long term is a plan. Seems consistent to me. It's just not sending thousands upon thousands of our soldiers to run a foreign country. You can not like it. You can not like the specifics. But that doesn't mean it's contradictory or unclear.

&gt; Well, if we took action in 2011 when ISIS was becoming a threat rather than make fun of them and call them the JV team - it wouldn't be to this point.

And when ISIS came in, would our presence have made any difference to the local population that sided with them? Would American troops being there have made them suddenly not dislike the Shiite government and want to completely fold automatically because they liked Sunni authoritarians better than Shiite ones?

They *were* the JV team. The problem is that parts of the population *liked* them.

&gt; Do you know that the US bombed Libya for 10 months in 2011 until the government was destroyed? Or do you think we had nothing to do with that?

Yes, I do. We didn't occupy it like we did Iraq, however. Not sure what you're getting at, there.

&gt; The Iraqi government began begging for help the minute ISIS invaded.

And then I listen to news reports saying that the people are in hiding because they don't trust ISIS *or* the government. Of course the government wants help- they are Shiite.

http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/05/19/407668874/after-a-big-victory-for-isis-iraqi-forces-look-to-regroup

From the article:

&gt; With Iraq's bloody history of sectarian violence, some leaders in Anbar say they see the Shiite militias to be just as threatening as ISIS. 

&gt; Researcher Donatella Rovera of Amnesty International says the fears of sectarian violence by the militias are justified.

&gt; ""All of the militias have a very well-proven track record of committing very serious human rights abuses, including war crimes,"" she says. 

&gt; In a sign of the deep suspicion common in Iraq, he even speculates that Iraq's Shiite-led government weakened local Sunni fighters on purpose, giving the government an excuse to send in Shiite fighters.

These are my qualms, and many people share them. But now we're just talking in circles. Lets cut to the chase. Ok, lets say Obama needs to be doing something different. Can you describe a plan that involves being effective in the long term that also has a specific exit strategy?",10253,29,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: &gt; Can I tell you that exact date? No. However - you don't seem to have this obsession with the Obama strategy - yet you seem to support it.

...again, I will repeat that I have addressed why I think specifics for timelines and exit strategies are more important for boots on the ground as opposed to air campaigns.

 &gt; You keep saying the Obama administration has a strategy and that it is ""To destroy ISIS""

No, they have a strategy to help others destroy ISIS.

&gt; I feel it is contradictory to say ""I will do whatever it takes to defeat ISIS - Except use our military on the ground""... and you don't see any contradiction there.

Huh? How about, ""I will do whatever it takes to defeat ISIS, except I won't hit the country of Iraq with nuclear weapons."" Is it still *wildly* inconsistent? Are we supposed to heckle at the press conference, ""But you said *whatever it takes!*""

&gt; Is restoring order more difficult than just bombing from the air? You bet. But the long term results of restoring order are far better than the years of just bombing from the air.

If you actually think of a plan as to how that will work. The Bush administrations implementation of De-Baathification and some quotes I'll provide below are just a taste of the wishful thinking an pure naivety displayed by their 'plan' for invasion.

&gt; &gt; Getting greeted as liberators and leaving before the year is out?

&gt; Huh? Are you talking about Libya? Because that was never a goal in Iraq.

http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/educate/war28-article.htm

These quotes don't make me think of a plan for long term restoration of order.

&gt; &gt; Finding Saddam? Killing Saddam? Having a democratic election? The surge?

&gt; Well, Killing Saddam was up to the Iraqis... but those were all goals as well. Yes.

And yet no announcement of a pullout when those things were either achieved, or in the case of WMDs, found not to exist. So again- mission creep. We achieved our goals and... just kinda stayed.

&gt; relative peace that Obama inherited when he took office in 2009.

Man, where do I begin.

First, withdrawal began in 2007. and, ""in 2008 George W. Bush signed the U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement. It included a deadline of 31 December 2011, before which ""all the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory"". The last U.S. troops left Iraq on 18 December 2011, in accordance with this agreement. US Forces ultimately returned to Iraq in June 2014.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_U.S._troops_from_Iraq

In fact, Obama actually wound up *extending* the length of the troop stay longer than what Bush wrote. You should probably just read the whole wiki to review. Case in point, the inference that Obama abruptly pulled the plug right before we were going to ""win"" is simply not supported by facts.

But secondly, in an more abstract view... in your own words you describe, ""the relative peace that Obama inherited when he took office in 2009"". Saddam and his regime dead and gone, no weapons of mass destruction, democratic elections, and now in your own words: ""relative peace"". Ok, so there was peace. So... why were we staying again?

&gt; The mistake was not taking out ISIS in Syria before they grew large enough to invade.

Man, between this and what I think you are implying about Libya, you have some pretty grand plans for attacking, invading and occupying the middle east. This could spin off into it's own conversation.

&gt;You use trained and accountable militaries (we happen to have the finest on earth) and you attack the enemy in their safe havens until they have none.

Attacking their safe havens until ""they have none"" (100% completion) means attacking, destroying, collaterally-damaging, and occupying the populace you are trying to win over. Also, as these areas are Sunni, you are implicitly helping Iran.

&gt; You don't hand out weapons to unacountable militias that then sell them to ISIS.

So much for ""gaining the support of tribal leaders"". Looks like we're doing this one alone.

&gt; You don't just bomb the place from the air and hope peace breaks out.

Yes, you are right. The Iraqis, and the middle east as a whole will need to work towards peace as well. We can provide support, which we are doing.

&gt; If you claim your goal is to defeat ISIS, you do your best to defeat ISIS.

Again, addressed above. Goal is to help others defeat ISIS.

&gt; You don't pretend as if you have no other choice than to sideline the strongest military on earth and rely on untrained militias.

The strongest military on earth tried to run that country for 8 years. Either they stay there forever, get shot at and blown up, or eventually hand it off to those militias and government forces.

If someone wants to tell me how many *more* years than that it will take to do it right, I'm all ears. And sure, I know you can't give an exact date. But hopefully we could come up with something more accurate than the difference between ""weeks rather than months"" and 8 years.

**Edit** punctuation","&gt; ""Five days or five weeks or five months, but it certainly isn't going to last any longer than that,"" - Donald Rumsfeld 2002

And the people who met the US troops in Bagdad and tore down saddam's statue and beat it with their shoes... that was that same 3 week mark. Those are the same Iraqis who signed up by the millions to participate as a member of the military,police, or various levels of government.

&gt;These quotes don't make me think of a plan for long term restoration of order.

Well that is because you are taking one sentence mostly out of context and applying it as if they were saying Iraq would suddenly becom e a Utopia. You aren't being honest in your approach.

Go read the ""Mission Accomplished"" speech, if you never have. Take a look at President Bush's State of the unions. The long term plan never changed and was easily explained as ""We will stand down when the Iraqis can stand up"". That includes training a military and police force, holding elections, driving out the insurgency, and staying until there was some semblance of order. Iraq was chaotic from 02-07. And after the surge, became very stable in comparison.

&gt;Man, where do I begin.

Oh. So you do agree? I can't really tell.... why would we stay? Well, by 08 the US and UK and allies had driven AQ to the outskirts of northern Iraq and Syria. Why should that matter? Well, when we allow them to find safehaven and regroup and rearm and train and recruit from 08-2014... we see the invasion of Iraq!

Did I say that? What I was getting at was that unilaterally going into Syria boots on the ground full force would be an invasion. Then going full surge into Libya instead of bombing and let the local resistance fight Quadaffi is another invasion. Then also continue to hold in Iraq, because we can't leave it? That seems like a whole lot of shock, awe, and occupation.

Man, we're getting off the rails, here. I'll cut to the chase.

You're a fan of the Iraq invasion and Bush. Everything is Obama's fault. Nothing I say can convince you otherwise. Fine.

As many years as we are asked to do so by allies and makes sense for us to do so. There. Now, can you answer the original question? I can set aside the Iraq War apologist shtick.

I dunno... plus or minus five years?",10253,33,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"B: Well, we have provided training and there is international air support (though in not sure what percentage of that coalition is the US, tbh).

We approved funding for a shipment of equipment to the Kurds, which apparently has yet to be delivered. People have been complaining about the delays.

The Germans seem to be much better with the Kurds, in this regard. In addition to air support and training, they seem to have taken the lead in terms of providing arms and gear.

They seem to be more pro west and protective of minorities than other groups in the region. Which is good, but there are still issues.

Their relationship with Turkey is very problematic, and has to be at play in the larger political view. Which, frankly in my opinion just sucks and I wish Turkey could get past it some how.

In terms of minorities, yes. They are far better. Though there have been some discussions of possible peshmerga war crimes. And the fact that we still list the PKK as a terrorist group also mucks up support/arms. Again, all this isn't remotely close to ISIS. But it isn't 100% clean, either.

And the more abstract issues are about the goals of the Kurds. They have said that they don't want to try and liberate places that don't welcome them. With the religious/ethnic prejudices at play in the country, this is basically saying that they certainly won't fight in every place ISIS pops up.

Then, it seems to be an agreed upon theory that much of the Kurds aggressiveness is in order to hold more territory for what could be claimed as a future Kurdistan once the dust settles with ISIS. Now, I don't have many real problems with them. They appear to be some of the better actors in the region.

But if you wind up not caring about them taking territory, you can piss of the sunni and shia in the country as well. The Iraqi government loves peshmerga killing Isis, but wouldn't hesitate to attack peshmerga to prevent the establishment of an official Kurdistan.

And that is another dynamic at play: all strategies are under the assumption that Iraq should be maintained as a single country. Really going all in with the Kurds puts that bigger vision in jeopardy.

Who knows? Maybe splitting Iraq into 3 parts is better in the long run. But no one seems to even be remotely close to making that an official policy right now. For better or worse.




","&gt; I don't believe anyone wants ISIS to thrive and grow. However, the way in which we stop ISIS seems to me to have no consensus or clear outline of goals, or a way to achieve them. I'd love to hear from people who disagree and can outline the strategy for me.

I think there is a clear goal: The destruction of ISIS.  And I think at least for the Iraq side there is a pretty clear strategy: militarily support the Iraqi government's efforts from the air and with targeted use of special forces, and diplomatically encourage  the Iraqi government to include Sunni leaders.

It turns out they are running up the bill, and trying to bring stability here in 2014 is much harder than it would have been in 2011 - all because of this ""We aren't willing to pay any price to defeat ISIS"" mentality.

As I recall the negotiations to extend the SoF agreement in 2011, the sticking point was strict respect of Iraqi sovereignty.  The price the Obama administration wasn't willing to ""pay"" to extend the mission in Iraq was to potentially see American soldiers on trial in an Iraqi court.  Would you have paid that price?

You know, in general I think that US soldiers in a war zone who commit crimes should pay a price.

Not only disgracing the uniform and all those who wear it, but the act provides aid and comfort to the enemy; Aid in recruitment and comfort in feeling that the US is just a bunch of monsters.

However; I don't accept your premise that the Obama administration made a sincere effort to negotiate anything. He campaigned on removing troops from Iraq, and bragged about it in the presidential debates in 2012. I'm not sure what more evidence is needed to convince people that he had no intention of negotiating.

So to answer your question more specifically - I'd agree to letting US soldiers get tried for treasonous acts if they commit them. I think it is the #1 issue with the war on terror. We need to hold our own accountable.

&gt;JOINT BASE LEWIS-McCHORD, Wash. — Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, who pleaded guilty to slaughtering 16 Afghan civilians inside their homes, will spend the rest of his life in prison, a military jury decided on Friday.

As for the Obama administration making a sincere effort at negotiation, the principle of Iraqi sovereignty wasn't up for negotiation.  It had become a political issue in Iraq. I do believe they made a sincere effort to extend the SoF agreement as for the most part Obama continued much the same Iraq policy as the Bush administration,  even so far as to keeping the same secretary of defense. 

 ","&gt;  I do believe they made a sincere effort

Fair enough. I am happy to agree to disagree. Since 07 President Obama promised to withdraw from Iraq as fast as possible regardless of Iraq's conditions.

"B: Yes we agreeing that Obama was insincere,  just at different points.  

In general I think what a politician says to get elected and what they do when they actually find themselves in the chair only bear the vaguest of similarities (eg. read my lips, no more taxes).  In the majority of cases (and in particular for Obama) they stick closer to the status-quo than they do to their rhetoric.      ","The Obama administration has been a complete disaster in terms of the Middle East.

In broad terms, in the post-Cold War and post-9/11 period, the US government has focused on promoting stability and democracy (""Failed State"" prevention), preventing nuclear proliferation, and combating Islamic terrorism. Under Mr. Obama's watch, Libya has been transformed from stable autocracy to civil war/anarchy, Iraq has continued to disintegrate, and either Iran or Saudi Arabia (or both likely) will obtain nuclear weapons in the near future.

Key failures (in my opinion):

- Not pressing harder to maintain a contingent of American troops in Iraq under extended SOFA. It was clear, both in 2011 and in retrospect, that the Iraqi security forces were plagued by incompetence and prone to sectarian violence, and would be unable to keep the tenuous piece. American advisors may have been able to mollify some of the issues with the ISF (lack of professionalism, reliance on militias, and so forth), as well as preventing ISIS' territorial expansion.

- Not demanding a better rebuilding strategy from the British and French in regards to Libya. Obama signed off on a bombing campaign, with little thought to the consequences. One cannot build a country with cash, or create peace through airstrikes. Europe lacks the political will and the miltary strength to nation build, and Mr. Obama should have required our allies to come up with a better plan for us to sign on.

- Not considering the Gulf states' interests when dealing with Iran. Obviously Iran's nuclear weapons are problematic as far as our global strategy/belief in preventing nuclear proliferation, but Mr. Obama has maintained his focus purely on the nuclear side, and not what Israel/Arab states may want. This position has caused the Saudis to doubt our commitment to their defense, as seen by their (relatively) unilateral intervention in Yemen. If the Saudis and Israelis cannot count on American leadership they will take action themselves, and without our approval or blessing.

Overall, I don't think the problem is anything that Obama has done specifically, but it's that the president has been *reactive* as opposed to *proactive*. He deployed a brigade sized element to Iraq to combat ISIS *after* large swaths of Sunni territory fell to the group. He authorized airstrikes against Libya *after* civil war broke out and the British and French committed to supporting the rebels. It seems that Obama was not prepared for the responsibility of managing the region - he expected that a reduced American presence would help, rather than hinder, efforts to stabilize the various areas we were involved in. Obama had no vision of America's role in the Middle East, and that has cost us dearly.

Where do we go from here? Well, I think Mr. Obama ought to consider fostering regional dialogue. Bring the Arab League, Israel, and Iran to the table, talk about the ongoing issues each group has with the other. If the president thinks the American military is not the solution,  actors in the relevant countries must be involved. Nobody wants failed states in Libya, in Yemen, in Syria. The US ought to take charge and present regional solutions. ",10253,47,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

When people hear the word socialism they think of the NAZIs who self-labeled as socialists and conflate socialism with communism.

Statistically, Socialism ranks lower than even atheism and islam in that order as positive factors in the eyes of voters.

As for the low religiosity of states with low income inequality, there is evidence that people use religion as social and thus financial support when they are less economically independant.  In economies were income inequality is low, people are less dependant on their immediate social ties and thus there isn't as strong an economic need to rely on traditional private safety nets such as churches and the like.  There is also less of a need for individuals to rely on those social ties to cope with their situation.","Given the rise in inequality, do you think moderate/liberal religion will  potential re-emerge from it's slumber?

&gt;I don't think it will end up making much of a difference in contemporary politics, though.

I dunno.. religion is more powerful in the US than Western Europe. Every senator has religious family, every politician has a life outside politics, most including a church community of some kind I imagine.

Plus, can you imagine if religious groups full of OAPs and clergy were marching toward police at the front? Hard to imagine that not being more powerful and harder to justify action against than what they would see as just a bunch of leftist hippies.

EDIT: on religions power.. I'm a complexity theorist who specialises in cultural evolution. It's important to remember that in terms of identity, we don't transform as a society from religion to state to corporate consumer. What happens instead is that identities accumulate over time. They will likely all be represented for centuries to come, unless AI changes us beyond recognition. What does tend to transfer is which identity has overall power.

I quote from the last item: 

&gt; There is no reason to feel sentimental about the Electoral College. One of the main reasons the founders created it was slavery. The southern states liked the fact that their slaves, who would be excluded from a direct vote, would be counted — as three-fifths of a white person — when Electoral College votes were apportioned.

I'm not sure what you mean by the 3/5 compromise was ""way later"". It was originally an amendment to the Articles of Confederation, it failed there but was carried straight into the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and written right into Article 1 of the Constitution.

The assertion that the electoral college was there to prevent the rabble from electing the wrong person ('prevent ""mob rule""') simply isn't true. Most colonies (and then states) had laws on the books with a minimum property requirement for voting, a practice at the time that was legal under the un-amended Constitution. Women couldn't vote, slaves couldn't vote, property-less freemen couldn't vote, so the vote was pretty well out of the hands of the ""mob"".

Giving Southern states a number of electoral votes equal to the number of legislators was an overt way to keep the Southern states in the presidential selection process.

[Flunking the Electoral College](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/opinion/20thu1.html)

I quote from the last item: 

&gt; There is no reason to feel sentimental about the Electoral College. One of the main reasons the founders created it was slavery. The southern states liked the fact that their slaves, who would be excluded from a direct vote, would be counted — as three-fifths of a white person — when Electoral College votes were apportioned.

I'm not sure what you mean by the 3/5 compromise was ""way later"". It was originally an amendment to the Articles of Confederation, it failed there but was carried straight into the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and written right into Article 1 of the Constitution.

The assertion that the electoral college was there to prevent the rabble from electing the wrong person ('prevent ""mob rule""') simply isn't true. Most colonies (and then states) had laws on the books with a minimum property requirement for voting, a practice at the time that was legal under the un-amended Constitution. Women couldn't vote, slaves couldn't vote, property-less freemen couldn't vote, so the vote was pretty well out of the hands of the ""mob"".

Giving Southern states a number of electoral votes equal to the number of legislators was an overt way to keep the Southern states in the presidential selection process. That's why 8 of the first 9 presidents were Virginians; if Virginia slaves were not counted 3/5 toward the presidential election, Virginia wouldn't have been a major power in the election process at all.

This is a common misconception. The republic was used to represent people with the problems of the past, non instant communication, a base population that wasn't educated enough to vote intelligently, and the size of the early US. However the representation in a republic doesn't require equality and it was a battle under the articles of confederation that favored states individually to even get population to matter at all. In the end a compromise was made that established a precedent that is hard to change. The problem with the electoral college isn't necessary the fact that it exists, it is the first pass the post system (winner takes all) and the problems of having the electoral college able to vote against the % breakdown of their state that makes it undemocratic.


A good alternative is relative. If you believe that the government is for the people and not by the people an electoral college could stop a flash political change that all the sudden could elect a hitler because the college members could simply say screw the public and vote against democratic approval. If you think the government is by the people then a direct election method should be used over all else.

The problem exists in the way votes are tallied more than the electoral college itself. The spoiler effect.

"B: There's also the fact that as a nation we were very susceptible to a propaganda campaign under a direct election scheme.  It could have been the British, the French, the Spanish, etc.

Back then, communication was slow and verification of credentials was almost non-existent.  Our country was young and a highly valuable target for takeover.  We had a quantity of unowned land the size of which was never seen before or since.  The electoral college protected the interests of an independent nation significantly during a time when that protection was very necessary.

The fact that the president with the most votes has only lost - what... twice? - in very close elections proves that it works.

Personally, I don't think the uproar caused by such an election will ever be enough to stir the country to change the model.  The only time the populous ever thinks about it is during Presidential elections, and during close elections the interest wains in months - not nearly long enough to merit interest in a constitutional amendment.

Not everyone in that one party supported it.  many democrats opposed the ACA in the house, and 4 senate democrats voted against the reconciliation amendment. 

&gt;Do you seriously believe that Bernie Sanders, the only openly avowed socialist in the United States Senate, enthusiastically voted for a health care reform bill that turned over exponentially more power to the private health care industry? 

First, exactly what power do you think was ""turned over"" to private industry?  Second, I don't care how enthusiastically Sanders voted, he did vote for the bill when many other democrats did not.  If sanders didn't like it, obama should have tried giving up his vote to negotiate a deal with republican moderates, the way bush did with no child left behind.  Bush originally wanted a bill with a strong school choice plank to win the support of more right wing republicans, but instead threw them, and school choice, overboard to buy ted kennedy's support, and the law eventually passed with more democratic votes than republican.

When people asked GOP spokespeople opposing reforms what doctors and Hospitals should do with the uninsured, the only GOP answer (if they even gave one) was along the lines of ""Well, maybe they shouldn't treat these people.""  Which is a round-about way of saying ""They should just die.""

So, when this major political party puts forward two ideas... one that's really just a token solution that won't change anything, and then when pressed comes up with ""Well, maybe the problem is that we treat the uninsured"", you are going to have to forgive me for taking this to the logical conclusion that the GOP platform was that people should just get sick and die. 


**However, I don't believe that ""Republicans don't care""**.  I honestly believe that the ""Maybe they shouldn't treat those without insurance"" line is a serious idea held by only a few people who are hard libertarians- but also what a lot of people who use poor argument tactics tend to say when they talk themselves into a corner (Palin is this kind of person- the kind of person who will say something completely ludicrous  rather than admit being wrong or not knowing the answer.  There's a lot of Dems who do this too, I just don't remember them as well as Palin, because most of them have never told me that I wasn't a Real American because I live in a city and don't worship Jesus.).

This is a huge problem in our political discourse.  The Dems do it too, and my proof is that they keep claiming that there's nothing wrong with Medicare/Social Security.  Which is absolutely wrong.  But just like the GOP and healthcare, they take the extreme opposite position rather than saying ""Well, we agree that there's a problem, but your solution is too extreme.  Let's compromise.""","&gt; When people asked GOP spokespeople opposing reforms what doctors and Hospitals should do with the uninsured, the only GOP answer (if they even gave one) was along the lines of ""Well, maybe they shouldn't treat these people.""

"B: First off, you seem to think that by demonstrating that individual Republicans have tried to fix things means that the GOP in general was able to come up with a proposal to insure the uninsured.

Ezni:  Dated 2013, not 2009 which was the time frame of this discussion

Every American Insured Act, major points: Establishes State Exchanges and Provides for the Expansion of Medicaid in states where needed.

If these things are so important to the GOP, why are they trying to end them now?  Why have so many GOP governors blocked medicaid expansion in their states?

The ""Healthy Americans Act"" was universal healthcare.  The GOP would never have passed this.  So while individual Republicans may have supported it, the GOP never would have.

The ""Patient's Choice Act"" looks a lot like the ACA, but replaces the mandate and ban on pre-existing conditions with a regulatory body.  However, the GOP has continuously opposed many of the same features of that act while fighting the ACA.  So I think it's disingenuous to claim that they would support this- unless their support is contingent on who submitted the bill (which is a problem with both sides, true).

Voters do not educate themselves and have no real reason to do so and are ['rationally ignorant'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance) that is there is no benefit to the person to educate themselves beyond their own biases. (Why learn something that doesn't agree with me? [Part of the problem with true neutrality]) 

He notes that generally voters have several biases, or conclusions about the world that effect their world view.

A Make-work bias where voters tend to associate economic growth with job growth. 

An Anti-foreign bias in which voters tend to underestimate the benefits of trade.

A Pessimistic bias where voters overestimate the severity of economic problems and underestimate the past performance of the economy

A Anti-market bias where voters tend to underestimate the benefits of the functions of the market.  

Anyway to get back to my point, if the voters are irrational and don't know what is best, because they are uniformed then the politicians will not act on their behalf, because what voters think they want, based on their biases is not actually good for the country and conflicts with the advisors opinions.   In the end the politicians have to do a mix of both good and bad policies in order to ger re-elected but also pass policies that will actually produce results (so they can also get re-elected).

Other authors place the blame on the politicians themselves, since we assume that politicians are 'rational actors' (meaning they work in the own self-intrest) they will largely work in the area of appeasing special intrest this behavior is called ""rent-seeking"" and is a part of [public choice theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice).

[Party List](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_List)

Used in UK Parliamentary elections, Holland, South Africa, Israel, Austria, Sweden and a number of small countries.

Advantages:

- Fewer wasted votes

- No minority vote Governments

- Can form coalition Governments

-Voters will have several representatives for their region

- Use of a high threshold means a chaotic multi-party system is avoided.

Disadvantages:

- Coalition Governments can be unstable

- Extremist parties can win seats

- Parties can manipulate party lists to put rebels as least likely to be elected and so called 'Yes men' are the most likely.

[Single Transferable Vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote)

Used in Eire and some Northern Irish elections.

Advantages:

-The voter votes for an individual and not for a party so there's a stronger sense of accountability than in Party List.

- Coalitions are still likely with the usual problems and inherent instability. 

[Additional Member System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additional_Member_System)

Used in Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly elections, the London Assembly, and the German elections. 

Advantages:

- More proportional than our current system but retains the same democratic principles and advantages

- Retains voter-representative link.

- Can produce an overall majority vote party if public feeling is sufficient.

Disadvantages:

- Proportional voting systems mean smaller parties have a large influence and can cause a compromise of policy or ideology.

- Deals no one voted for can be produced, a notable case being Germany where a coalition Government was forged between the Socialist and the Conservatives - Yikes.

- Time period between negotiation between political parties when forging coalition Governments means instability throughout the nation.

- Extremists can win seats.

That funding comes from tax payers, and if we know anything about tax payers, it's that they want to be less of a tax payer.

"B: [Here](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/b_sched_chron.pdf) is a list of the substances currently on the DEA schedule. While original poster has listed some of the drugs by their ""street names"", the DEA list is a bit more clinical. 

There are definitely some drugs that shouldn't be Schedule I; MDMA, for instance, had known clinical applications before it was listed as Schedule I (used in couple's therapy). Methamphetamine was used clinically before other, less harsh versions came on the market; these versions are much better therapeutically, but that doesn't change the fact that methamphetamine does have clinical uses. Heroin, as an opiate, is a great painkiller. Oxy and other similar chemicals mimic its effects; it seems reasonable to say that heroin, too, has therapeutic use. That said, the standard isn't ""has a medical use"" - 

&gt;  no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.

The use has to be currently accepted. This is a bit of a catch-22; doctors can't prescribe Schedule I drugs, so there can't be ""currently accepted medical use in treatment IN THE US"" if doctors can't prescribe the drug. By this standard, though, street methamphetamine and heroin both fail - they aren't currently medically accepted (because better/safer versions exist); Desoxyn is methamphetamine that's Schedule II, but it's a pharma product, so I guess that makes it safer and more medically accepted? 

GHB is Schedule I, but according to the DEA's list, FDA-approved GHB products are Schedule III. Those products are used to treat narcolepsy and depression. My guess is that the ""street form"" of the drug would be Schedule I, but the pharmaceutical form would be Schedule III. 

LSD isn't widely accepted for medical use (though the studies are interesting), largely because it's hard to do the studies or get a large enough sample size to definitively show (in a controlled trial) that LSD helps cluster headaches. It primarily fails on the addictive requirement, but that's where most of these that make so little sense fail. 

My best guess at the logic here is that the FDA can overrule the DEA (to some extent), because it has to be medically accepted and FDA approval implies medical acceptance (though that does require lots of animal and human trials that are hard to get if it's Schedule I). If drug companies aren't motivated to get something through clinical trials, it stays classified as Schedule I. ","&gt;Because better/safer versions exist.

I'd say that's the key to why several drugs are on the list. They may have a medical application but if that application has been deprecated by drugs that are demonstratsbly superior in every facet, is that application actually practical? Heroin is a good example as it has obvious uses despite the existence of numerous replacements that match or beat its advantages over Morphine which it was intended to replace (I've been trying to find sources that show some area where it is superior to opioid alternatives so feel free to prove me wrong).",9536,18,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

Cocaine is another matter.  Not only is it Schedule II, you'll find it in most hospital pharmacies because it's particularly useful in certain surgeries.  

Can't get heroin, but just about all the heavy hitter opioids are, from morphine to oxycodone.

"A: &gt; What logic is the DEA using to keep these substances in Schedule I?

Their hands are tied by our international treaties and congress. ","I realize that this conversation is seven days old, but there are a lot of wonky answers here that talk about political reasons, practical reasons, or just 'bad faith' reasons that the DEA does this. But that's not the real answer to your question. Sure, we can assume that the DEA has a vested interest in policing drugs and that, therefore, they will have an interest in having more drugs to police. But that is a weak, *weak* answer because it ignores the fact that the DEA *does* follow these factors and they have been found to have acted reasonably in scheduling marijuana (and other drugs) by federal courts a number of times. 

With that in mind, the (legal) answer is that the DEA can schedule drugs like this because the DEA gets to define what words like ""potential for abuse,"" ""currently accepted medical treatment,"" and ""accepted safety"" mean. These are ambiguous terms (i.e., reasonable people can differ as to what ""potential for abuse"" means). When a statute directing an enforcement agency to do certain things has ambiguous terms, the agency itself is empowered with the ability to define those terms in a way that they are workable. The agency gets to choose what Congress meant by saying ""potential for abuse,"" as long as it is a reasonable interpretation of that term. 

This is an important rule because it is truly impossible for Congress, when creating a statute covering such wide areas as drug abuse, to create legislation with such specificity that it can perfectly define every term and scenario that might be encountered. So the agency has to have some amount of discretion to fill in these gaps, otherwise enforcing the legislation would become unworkable. What's more is that, when an agency defines an ambiguous term, it is given Chevron deference - named after the case Chevron v. NRDC, if you care to read it. Essentially it means that courts must *defer* to the agency's interpretation as long as it is reasonable (i.e., the court can't decide that ""potential for abuse"" actually means X when the agency says it means Y, as long as Y is a reasonable definition of that term.

So, how does the DEA define these terms? They have created a list of subfactors that are more specific than the generalized scheduling factors that Congress put into the CWA. For instance, in order to determine if a substance has a ""currently accepted medical use,"" they look at the following factors:

&gt;(1) The drug's chemistry must be known and reproducible;
&gt;(2) there must be adequate safety studies;
&gt;(3) there must be adequate and well-controlled studies proving efficacy;
&gt;(4) the drug must be accepted by qualified experts; and
&gt;(5) the scientific evidence must be widely available.

[ACT v. DEA.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9842327817238142794&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=40000006)

(Notably, these five factors were created after the DEA was challenged about a previous 8 factor test that was even more vague [and potentially impossible for a currently scheduled substance to meet]). Obviously these are much more specific than the term in the CWA. But even these have some wiggle room. ""Adequate safety studies,"" ""adequate and well-controlled studies,"" ""widely available,"" ""qualified experts,"" etc. The agency *also* has the discretion to explain these terms.

So the point is that *you* may think it is transparently obvious that marijuana, to choose an example, has a ""currently accepted medical use."" But you are not considering the factors that the DEA considers to come to that conclusion. There may be certain studies, but the DEA may not credit them as ""well-controlled,"" or ""adequate."" You may find a doctor that says he accepts marijuana, but the DEA may not find him qualified, or may not find that that opinion is accepted widely enough. It is the DEA's opinion that matters here, not every individual member of the public. (More than that, actually, it's also the DHHS's opinion - and they agree with the DEA!)

So, why does marijuana (for example, again) not meet the ""currently accepted medical use"" factor? Well, the DEA helpfully explains in its denial of petitions to reschedule marijuana - of which there are several. Here's an excerpt:

&gt;To establish accepted medical use, the effectiveness of a drug must be established in well-controlled, well-designed, well-conducted, and well-documented scientific studies, including studies performed in a large number of patients (57 FR 10499, 1992). To date, such studies have not been performed. The small clinical trial studies with limited patients and short duration are not sufficient to establish medical utility. Studies of longer duration are needed to fully characterize the drug's efficacy and safety profile. Scientific reliability must be established in multiple clinical studies. Furthermore, anecdotal reports and isolated case reports are not adequate evidence to support an accepted medical use of marijuana (57 FR 10499, 1992). The evidence from clinical research and reviews of earlier clinical research does not meet this standard.

[Americans for Safe Access v. DEA, quoting Denial, 76 Fed. Reg. at 40,579.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7920687753832005040)

I'll pose the same question to you that I pose to others when this topic comes up - what part of that analysis do you find to be so unreasonable that you can say that the DEA has no basis for its decision? Because that's how a court would look at it. It's not enough that you disagree, or that you can choose other definitions that would change the result.

Better yet, here is the whole Federal Register document denying a petition to reschedule marijuana:  [Denial Of Petition To Initiate Proceedings To Reschedule Marijuana](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/07/08/2011-16994/denial-of-petition-to-initiate-proceedings-to-reschedule-marijuana). It is grotesquely long, detailed, and sourced with dozens of citations justifying the DEA's position on the matter. The idea that they are making these decisions without justification is completely unsupportable.

So the answer, to bring this full circle, is that there are multiple ways to interpret the definitions in the CWA. And the DEA is the one who is given the statutory power to decide which interpretation to follow. The premise of your question is inherently flawed - they do fit the definitions, just not definitions that you want the DEA to use. ",9536,31,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics

Not true. Food is very easy to access as there are many suppliers for it. This invites price competition for food. Medical care is specialized and requires a person with a lot of training to provide the service. This leads to less suppliers in the market with a steady demand not based on wants but needs.

We certainly have a strong correlation between student loan magnitudes and tuition.

It makes perfect sense from an economic theory standpoint that, if you give consumers more credit that they can only spend on certain goods (here, college education), they will bid prices up in that sector.

The universities don't even have high profit margins either; they waste so much money on unneeded real estate and capital equipment and professors and programs that don't have strong employment upon graduation.

Public universities could've cut 100% of their lost revenue from lost state aid by selling real estate, capital equipment, and laying off professors that did not amount to a higher return.

It looks like Healthcare is quite affordable with this system. They are [listed](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44844/1/9789241564441_eng.pdf) as having really low health expenditures per person. 4.1% of GDP in 2009, compared with 10% in Sweden and 9.8% in the UK (Page 140, for those who are curious).

Glancing at WHO's health profile for each of these countries ([Singapore](http://www.who.int/gho/countries/sgp.pdf), [Sweden](http://www.who.int/gho/countries/swe.pdf), and the [United Kingdom](http://www.who.int/gho/countries/gbr.pdf)) is also pretty enlightening. Compared to the UK, Singapore has much better standards of immunization, life expectancy, and mortality. Compared to their respective regions, it looks like Singapore outshines the UK as well. Compared with Sweden, immunization, life, expectancy, and mortality are much closer (practically identical, actually).

This is by no means an exhaustive comparison, but it is interesting.

Our current programs absolutely do drive up healthcare costs but there are far more important drivers then these programs, chief among the other reasons is the employer healthcare deduction which alone is responsible for the majority of the problem.

There are a bunch of ways to deal with subsidization without (significantly) driving up costs (only offering free/subsidized care at government run facilities for instance) and i'm sure our final solution once ACA runs its course will take this in to account.

Also we are less concerned with catastrophic insurance (it makes very little difference if people pay a premium to a private company for it or if the government simply does a HSA yearly maximum subsidization) then we are with cost participation (everyone should pay something even if its very very small, $10 for a heart transplant for instance) and restoring price information to the market (people pay for things directly not via insurance).","I think this is the best answer so far, but who is ""we"" in the fourth paragraph?  Is that ""we, the People,"" ""we, the folks who work at HealthcareEconomist's think tank,"" or ""we, the royal we""?",5123,45,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"A: 
Here is the solution for the high cost of healthcare in the US.

There has never been a proper market for healthcare. The doctor only profits when we are sick or injured. A good market would pay the doctor when we are healthy and cost the doctor when we are sick or injured 

We pay a subscription fee for medical insurance when we are healthy. The insurance companies pay doctors and hospitals a portion of that subscription fee when we are sick. US citizens pay private insurance companies 2.5 trillion dollars a year for access to doctors and hospitals. The insurance companies keep more of our money when we are healthy. The medical professionals only make money by charging the most they possibly can for visits and procedures. The incentives are all wrong and this is why medical costs are so high. We should pay doctors and hospitals a subscription fee when we are healthy in exchange for a commitment from doctors and hospitals to take care of every healthcare need. In other words, we should stop giving 2.5 trillion a year to insurance companies and give that money directly to the people that give us care. Doctors are hopefully smart people. They do not need a corporate gatekeeper with a Masters degree in business to dole out money to them. 
 
Here is how it would work. You pay your primary doctor each month who then contracts with a range of specialists and a hospital or two in your area. Your market choice becomes any primary care practice in your area. Your doctor is a part of a national reciprocation network that covers you when you travel and part of the money you pay your doctor goes into a national catastrophic fund for those rare illnesses that require travel and extended care. Prices would come down through competition. The hundreds of millions taken out in insurance company operations and profit could go to lower the price. Hospitals would be fully funded without having to admit a single patient so charging $80 for a box of tissues would end. Doctors would earn more money than investment bankers so the Doctors shortage would be over in a few years. The primary care doctor would be the center of the medical universe and he is already paid before you get sick so no unnecessary procedures or follow up visits. There would many alternatives like webcam diagnosis and phone call follow-ups that would be great for patients. How much illness is spread because Doctors cannot be paid unless sick people all gather and wait in the same room?
 
If we combine this change with strong malpractice tort reform then doctors will be able to reach out and be much more charitable. They will already be paid well so if we can limit the risk of giving care then doctors who are inclined to do so can give reduced rates or even free care for those who cannot afford their regular rates. In the US, the crux of the problem is charging by the visit or by the procedure. It is the wrong incentive. Doctors are paid more when the patient is sick. If you pay the doctor when you are healthy like you do the health insurance companies then the financial incentive to the doctor is to have you healthy and at home and not visiting or having a procedure.
 
A single person pays an average of $6,000 (including employer contributions) dollars a year for health care coverage. If that person is healthy he will see the doctor an average of three visits per year. Assume the average visit pays the doctor's practice $300. That is $900 dollars out of $6000 that goes to the doctor. Now suppose the entire $6,000 goes to the doctor. He uses half of that money to contract with a range of specialists practices and a hospital so that all of your local health needs are met. He also uses a bit of that half to add you to a reciprocation network so that you are fully covered when you travel. He also contributes a bit into a national catastrophic care fund that handles rare expensive cases that involve traveling to a specialist and experimental treatments etc. The doctor's practice now has $3000 guaranteed dollars from you instead of a speculative $900. That is more than three times what the doctor could eek out charging by visit. Everything but consumables is paid for. All salaries, the building, all the testing equipment is all paid in full before you arrive. The doctor is competing with the dozens of other practices in your community. The specialists and the hospitals are competing to be in the doctors networks. There is a lot of room for lower prices in this model. There is no compulsion to go back to the petrie dish waiting room for a follow up. much more cost effective for the doctor to call or skype. Internet medicine would no longer be stifled by insurance company or government rules. The internist or GP doctor would be the center of the medical universe as it should be.

Notice that this solution does not mention government. This plan would only require a consensus of courageous doctors to implement. The national average payout for medicare is more than $6000 a year. Government could pay the primary doctor on your behalf but the relationship and decisions would be between you and the doctor only. 
","To me, this just sounds like an insurance-based system, only you're asking doctors to manage it rather than business majors.

It's a very interesting idea, and you've obviously put a great deal of thought into it.

&gt;Doctors are hopefully smart people. They do not need a corporate gatekeeper with a Masters degree in business to dole out money to them.

So every single doctor should not only be working 60 hours a week seeing patients, but also run their own small business?  Plus, who's managing this national reciprocation network?  Seems like there would be an absurd amount of overhead with trying to coordinate patients being sent all over the country for various reasons and costs.

&gt;Doctors would earn more money than investment bankers so the Doctors shortage would be over in a few years. 

Hah.  Most medical schools have an acceptance rate of ~6%, even unranked medical schools. 60% of applicants get into 0 schools.  Making more people want to be doctors is not going to make more doctors.  People are not going to medical school for large paychecks, they want to help patients.  We already have too many of these people to accommodate them, bringing in additional people who are more concerned with financial gain than the health of their patients is not going to be helpful.  

&gt;webcam diagnosis

Not a good way to go about examination.  There's a lot of things that goes on in an examination that we just can't do through technology.  You can't feel a patient's lymph nodes, feel clamminess in the skin, muscle tension, etc.  Using virtual examinations is going to reduce the quality of care by putting something between the doctor and the patient.  Providing every patient with equipment advanced enough to provide sufficient information?  That's not exactly reducing costs. 

&gt;the financial incentive to the doctor is to have you healthy and at home and not visiting or having a procedure.

Isn't this going to put pressure on doctors to send patients home as soon as possible?  I think that the goal should be to provide the best care and ensure that the patient is leaving in the **best** health possible, not **sufficiently** healthy.  Is it better to provide incentive to cut corners on a patient's health or to do a little extra?  What about those with chronic and terminal conditions? There's no way to make them healthy, why even bother giving them any care?

Is it really good practice to treat your health as a commodity that doctors will compete for?  I personally don't want to think quality care is only worth X amount to me.  Health is not a commodity; it is priceless and universal.  ",5123,66,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: &gt;Under my plan, Doctors could work half days and see one third the patients and make the money they do now.

We have too many patients and not enough doctors, how is this going to happen?

&gt;for decades the best and brightest have not chosen medicine.

You can't be serious about this.  You're saying that most applicants to med schools are simply incompetent and that's why there's a 6% acceptance rate?  The rate is so low because schools are only willing to accommodate a certain number of students, they do not raise this number often.  How is attracting more people to the field actually going to increase the number of doctors?  The acceptance rate will simply drop to an average of 4% instead, with no real gains in # of physicians.  The average quality of physicians may increase, but the amount won't.

&gt;No one wants to spend so many difficult years education and training to become a government employee. Or to have to beg to insurance people for their hard earned money.

&gt;I want a doctor with a profit motive.

I can tell that you don't really understand healthcare as a profession or the people who want to work in it.  Is it really that hard to believe that there are people who are interested in more than money?  Are you making the assumption that doctors are not already doing everything in their power to heal patients?  Those who are genuinely concerned about patients make better doctors.  As your comment implies, people do not enter healthcare for the money, they do it because they want to help people and maybe make a difference in someone's life.  If no one wants to make the amount of sacrifice necessary to be a doctor, then why are there still too many applicants for too few spots?  

&gt;humans give the best possible care to their commodities. I want a doctor with a profit motive.

So, do salesmen have your best interest in mind?  Wanting to make a profit from you may not always be in your best interest.  What happens to people who can't afford to pay the subscription fees?

&gt;I would jump at the chance to not travel to sit in a room with sick people.

I realize that you don't want to be around sick people, but a virtual examination is not going to be as thorough as being there in person.  Every doctor distributing medical equipment advanced enough to even take your vitals to every patient is not feasible.  The costs would be enormous and the pros do not outweigh the cons.


I like your goals of increasing the number of doctors and giving them more freedom and autonomy while reducing their workload.  I just don't think this is the best way to accomplish those goals though, and I honestly don't really know how we can reform an entire nation's healthcare system either.  ","&gt;We have too many patients and not enough doctors, how is this going to happen?

The economic barriers to becoming a doctor will have been lifted. The fact that doctors can write their own ticket, design their own lifestyle is part of that. Most doctors will opt to profit more than half days.

&gt;You can't be serious about this. You're saying that most applicants to med schools are simply incompetent and that's why there's a 6% acceptance rate?

You are saying that only a small percentage of the population qualify to be a doctor. I do not accept that. Many popular professions of the last couple of decades have the intelligence to be doctors. The tech sector is one example, anyone who can code at a high level could learn to be a doctor. The financial sector is another, evaluating stocks and markets successfully requires quite a high level of reasoning. Both of these sectors offered easier better money. Both are somewhat fucked now. If medicine offered the payout many would take the harder road.

&gt;I can tell that you don't really understand healthcare as a profession or the people who want to work in it. Is it really that hard to believe that there are people who are interested in more than money?

Please give me a break with this. I want better doctors. I want doctors who will stand up and stop letting third parties take money from them. I do not want my doctor to have the herd mentality of a sheep waiting for others to tell him where to stand or what to do. I want a greedy fucking bastard of doctor.

&gt;So, do salesmen have your best interest in mind?

No - I am certain the guy that sold the CFO of the company you work for the health coverage that your family uses does not have my best interest or yours in mind. Salesmen do not make the bacon pork bellies are a commodity).

&gt;What happens to people who can't afford to pay the subscription fees?

The same thing that happened to people who could not afford doctors before the insurance companies and government made giving away medical care nearly impossible. Private charity and benevolent doctors would care for most of them.

&gt;I realize that you don't want to be around sick people, but a virtual examination is not going to be as thorough as being there in person. Every doctor distributing medical equipment advanced enough to even take your vitals to every patient is not feasible. The costs would be enormous and the pros do not outweigh the cons.

The doctor and the patient would make the call. I get sinus infections occasionally. I know the symptoms. When I have those symptoms and the doctor can confirm that remotely then he would be free to just call me in some antibiotics without the travel and the cost of a visit.

The tech for the medical monitoring is available now as smartphone add ons for a couple of hundred bucks or less. It would be an optional purchase for patients or a value add for doctors who need to attract patients.

&gt;and I honestly don't really know how we can reform an entire nation's healthcare system either.

We do not have to reform the nation's system. We simply need better doctors. If the doctors stand up then no one else has a choice but to follow their lead. Medicine should be delivered on the doctor's terms. They went to school, did the work, have the knowledge. We need better doctors to take back healthcare from the corporations and the government.",5123,69,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: I think you're misinterpreting what I mean when I say there is a low acceptance rate.  I think that there are *too many qualified applicants* for a very limited number of seats in the class.  Most medical schools have about 100 seats in the incoming class.  There are about 5,000 applicants for those 100 seats, and most of them are smart enough to be doctors.  If you attract more people from business, then there are 7,000 applicants for 100 seats.  In either case only the best make it in, and there are the same number of doctors churned out after 4 years, 100 new doctors.  This is what makes the situation different from most supply/demand models of business.  We have too many patients asking for more doctors and we have too many applicants who want to be doctors, but can't.  We are bottle necked at training.  We are not having a shortage of qualified applicants we are having a shortage of seats/medical schools.  If we suddenly have all doctors seeing 1/3 of the patients they currently do, then the other 2/3 are going to be waiting in line since there won't be enough doctors to go around.  Doctors are currently booked full and cutting their workload can only mean some people don't get to see a doctor at all.  The only way to fix the shortage of doctors is to open up more medical schools.

&gt;I want a greedy fucking bastard of doctor.

&gt;Private charity and benevolent doctors would care for most of them.

Completely contradictory.  I know the system now isn't working for them, but this isn't going to work either.  Flooding the field with greedy people isn't going to make relying on charity a feasible plan.

You may think virtual examinations are ok, but I wouldn't trust a patient to diagnose himself.  How do you know that Bob over there is as familiar with sinus infections as you are?  

&gt;I do not want my doctor to have the herd mentality of a sheep waiting for others to tell him where to stand or what to do.

Have you ever worked in healthcare or shadowed a doctor?  If you had then you would know that nobody tells a doctor what to do, their job is to take care of a patient how he sees fit.  If not, then who is and what's the purpose of having doctors at all?  From the patient's perspective they don't see the doctor for very long, but I can assure you they are not just standing around waiting for someone to tell them to see the next patient.  

You also keep saying that you want better doctors.  I think you may be underestimating what it takes to be a doctor.  They don't go through 8+ years of intense study and training for nothing.  And that's *if* they can get into a school.  A good doctor is one that knows his shit, and is willing to do everything necessary for a patient.  A mediocre doctor is one that knows his shit, but only wants to do the bare minimum for his patients.  If doctors start to consider the best interest of the patient secondary to money, he will perform the cheapest treatments possible.  If there's treatment A and treatment B and A costs $50,000 with a chance of success around 60% and treatment B costs $5,000 with a success rate of 30%.  It's more cost efficient for him to give you B since you pay one price, but he has to spend more on one over the other.  You would be better off with A, you would be more likely to be healed and get back to work.  It doesn't matter to him whether or not you can get back to work in 1 month or 3 as long as you can still pay him (assuming 2 months of subscription is less than 45,000).  That's one reason why I don't want greedy ass doctors.  There's more to healthcare than giving a patient a drug and sending them home.  They have to interact with patients and educate them, they have to workout what's best for the patient, not the doctor, the hospital, the HMO, or the government.  Doctors who can communicate well and have good relationships with their patients are less likely to be sued for malpractice because they can communicate that they have done everything the could and shown that they care about the patient and not just their wallet.  Currently hospitals and HMO's provide pressure for doctors to make money over the patient's best interest (unnecessary procedures to drive up cost), in your system it's the doctors putting pressure on themselves to cut costs, not necessarily at your benefit either.

When you say we need better doctors to stand up, I think you mean we need businessmen, politicians, and lawyers to help do this because most doctors have no business/economic/legislative experience and don't have the time to invest themselves into all of this at once.  We don't have mediocre healthcare because our doctors aren't good enough at practicing medicine, they're plenty good enough; it's the system that is not working effectively and it's not as simple as telling people to pay doctors directly.  There's gonna be a ton of bureaucratic bullshit to get there and we may not even end up with better care. ","&gt;I think you're misinterpreting what I mean when I say there is a low acceptance rate.

New schools will happen for determined candidates in an open market. Who has the incentive now to keep the number of doctors low? Answer the payers (insurance and government).

He argues that government involvement *always* leads to higher prices, which is proven false by the U.S. postal service (just try to get Fed Ex to take a letter to Hawaii for less than 50 cents).

His argument is based on a faulty premise: that health care was better, more affordable, before government involvement. Here is the important question: Why did Medicare come about? What caused the government to decide to step into the health insurance business for older people? And here is the answer:

Medicare was begun because older Americans could not afford health insurance or health care. Medicare was begun because the market for health care at that time was *failing.* Too many older people were dying unnecessarily. We as a society decided we could not ethically stand by and watch old people die needlessly. Those old people were parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles--family members were dying because they could not afford insurance or treatment. And we--as a country, as a society--felt we were ethically bound to not let that happen. And so Medicare came into being.

That right there is open and shut - a complete trashing of the 4th Amendment.

This issue alone justifies everything Snowden did.  And he did a lot more: the NSA has been subverting all of our cryptography, weakening it at a very low level.  This is, among other problems, a violation of the *2nd Amendment* of all things - and if you think that's crazy, go find out exactly why they tried to prosecute Phil Zimmerman about 25 years ago.  US law has long considered hard crypto a weapons tech; members of the Founding Fathers used encrypted letters on paper during the Revolution so this isn't a new concept.

Snowden also started a discussion on privacy that was much needed and expanded beyond merely his own releases.  As one example, a key NSA contractor was being allowed to do ""black hat hacking"" for profit.  Endgame was forced to get out of the business of buying previously unknown (""zero day"") exploits for Windows, iOS and the like:

Bastards were selling access to hacking services at $2.5mil per 25 machines hacked.  We hope it wasn't US government systems at risk but who knows.

However, this is much more pervasive (and subtle) when it comes to economic policy. It is impossible to find informed opinion on the news that isn't rabidly pro-capitalist. And why not? Because it does not serve the interests of the owners of for-profit news firms, nor the interests of the firms advertising on those shows. As a result, most Americans haven't even the foggiest idea what non-capitalist economic ideas even *are*. Hell, they don't even understand what *capitalism* is. Big corporations influence public opinion this way, and then they also influence public policy via campaign donations, ensuring that - to the level they can control - public policy and public opinion align with *their* goals.

Ok so we can look at that; the main cause of economic collapse in post-WW1 Germany were loss of land, tariffs and the Versailles Treaty. 

Prior to and during WW1 Germany had recently industrialized and was big in steel production especially taking over the Alsace-Lorraine further pushed them along in steel production.  After the war they lost territory, including the Alsace-Lorraine region.  They received money from the US to help rebuild, but once the Great Depression hit it effected the world and of course, Germany.

It was spending on infrastructure and military that brought the German economy back; very military Keynesian. Although this was short term because they neglected everything else.  But if you want to get into that you can look at Hjalmar Schacht who was in charge of economics in Germany in WWII.  Who also saw the benefit of having a fiat currency and kept interest rates low and the deficit high.  Germany saw the largest jump in employment than any other country during the course of the Great Depression. Of course Hitler later fired Schacht and destroyed the German economy himself.

"C: I think one of the reasons you don't see people who aren't the type to demand free things protesting is because they have full and busy lives. Maybe this is an over simplification (and just my opinion) but after a full day of work, you come home to your family, you raise your kids and spend time with your wife/husband, you don't want to run out in the streets and chant demands. Up until a point, I think the current government is very skilled at keeping conditions just good enough that we all see things are going downhill, but are more invested in our home lives. They pretend voting impacts this but like I said before, if both parties have the same relationship with the economy voting for either major political party doesn't bring about change.

On the other hand if you are unemployed, don't go to school, don't have any prospects for your future, it's easy to get mad at the world. Your start looking for someone to blame, the government is an easy target. You take to the streets with signs, you protest, you demand more and better.","I think this is pretty accurate. I just think it's too bad those people often demand things instead of freedom itself. Because even if they completely overthrow an oppressor, a new one takes its place. Until people learn it is better to depend on each other rather than an oppressor, the cycle will continue. ",4880,54,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: The governed is not a single entity in practical terms. Different occupations, religions, ethnicities, classes, etc. have both opposing and shared interests in myriad policy arenas. These same sometimes hostile sometimes friendly factions are also tasked with overseeing the government through popular elections--a task which is comically difficult given the size of any modern first world government. So combine the difficulty of oversight if we were a homogeneous people with a single will and the fact that were are heterogeneous and you get our current situation where a small plurality of individuals are able to band together to influence government. 

That was a bit vague but I think the gist of what I mean is clear.  ","I don't know if this does your comment justice, but could it be said that, because most general populations are more heterogeneous than homogeneous, a small group of like-minded individuals have an easier time of rising up the political ladder and taking over due to an un-unified populace?",4880,59,1,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: I don't know if this does your comment justice, but could it be said that, because most general populations are more heterogeneous than homogeneous, a small group of like-minded individuals have an easier time of rising up the political ladder and taking over due to an un-unified populace?","That is one of the premises. That coordination between small, unified groups is easier. But that doesn't explain everything (not that my theory does). A small group can't determine the outcome of a group decision if everyone is invested in the decision, is informed, and is able to take some type of action to affect the outcome. But those pre-requisites simply are not possible for the unimaginable number of group decisions large, modern, first-world nations make. For example, I do not have the time to determine whether the pollutants of some factory thousands of miles from me should be regulated to a certain parts per million standard or a different part per million standard. I will not read the studies, listen to the manufacturers; townspeople; and upstream customers, nor am I really even able to affect that outcome with my vote. But a small group of people focusing on the issue can affect such a change. The secret is that they purchase people to fulfill the pre-requisites I mentioned above. Monied interests purchase people with expertise and access. And the money gives these expert persuaders an interest in the outcome. These purchased people are scientists, lawyers, accountants, former government executives,  and proper lobbyists. Thus, it is both their ability to coordinate and ALSO our inability to focus in on these countless group decisions that allows oversight to drift from the governed to the government.

This is of course missing major pieces to the puzzle. To do this topic justice would require several books that I am not qualified to write. But I think at least those two components, (1) coordinated interests versus uncoordinated interests and (2) inability to match interest/expertise/ability to act, are major components. 

I think that ""something for nothing"" narratives, like those mentioned elsewhere in this conversation, are overly simplistic and do not get at the heart of the matter--the difficulty of simultaneously delegating individual autonomy to a representative while maintaining efficient oversight of such a representative as well as the difficulty of just majoritarian rulemaking. At best, it is a tiny part of a difficult and complicated human organization issue.",4880,60,0,subreddit-NeutralPolitics
"C: Even in ancient Rome, dicatators were appointed to resolve a particular crisis and were then expected to step down. It was romantically viewed as a burden to be appointed dictator in elitist Roman literature. Just look at the story of Cincinnatus (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnatus).
What is most interesting about Ukraine right now is, where is the crisis that would justify the power grab to the population. This is pretty bold.","I think that there are certain situations that may justify non-democratic governance:  

-  Acute state of crisis: The country is in turmoil. There is no possibility for democratic processes. Lincoln was temporarily in such a situation. 
- Ongoing state of crisis / civil war: It may be that there is an ongoing crisis, for example a civil war where there would be enough time and the right infrastructure to organise elections and votes, but there are two or more parties that can't agree on basics and that block each others, thus paralising the democratic system. Ex-Yougoslavia may have been such a situation. As long as there was a strong ""benevolant dictator"" ([Tito](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josip_Broz_Tito)), the country worked well. When he died, there was civil war.

In both these situations, I think it's to a limited extend justified to turn away from democracy. 

However, my impression is that the most (ab)used ""justification"" for turning away from democracy is the assumption that the people is not right, that the governors know better than the governed what is good for them. Situations: 

- Iran: The people want more freedom, but the governors assume that the people would turn immoral without proper guidance.
- Various dictators: They assume that they know better what is good for their country (e.g. North Korea).

First, since we don't have the full scope of their operations it's not really possible to say if Europe is a main focus or a side show for them.

That meant he only had access to low level security documents. The majority of the documents were classified as No-Forn (not to be read by a foreigner) a handful were classified as ""Secret"" and I don't think a single one of them were classified as Top Secret.

The reason this data dump is so huge is that it was pulled in bulk from SIPRNET, the network that all intelligence analysts have pretty much open access to. A lot of what was classified (and was contained in the cablegate leaks) is seen by some analysts as an example of the severe *overclassification* on the part of the US government that's been happening since 9/11.

He blindly acquired what documents he could and handed them over to a third party without knowing what info they contained. I'm not going to argue whether the info actually placed anyone at risk, but the fact that he never bothered to check that himself made it a very reckless act that had potential to put people at risk.

&gt; Georgia secretary of state and gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp improperly purged more than 340,000 voters from the state&amp;#039;s registration rolls, an investigation charges.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s the latest voting rights controversy to crop up in the Georgia governor&amp;#039;s race, which pits Republican Kemp against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who if elected would become the first African American woman governor of any state.

&gt; &amp;quot;Brian Kemp has abused his power as secretary of state of Georgia to purge the voting rolls of Georgia primarily of black and brown people,&amp;quot; said Joe Beasley, an Atlanta civil rights activist.

"C: One, the SCOTUS did not confirm that our ""exact match' system was in compliance with the NVR Act because it never got to them. [Georgia settled the suit and agreed to never use it again in 2016-2017](https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/georgia-settles-federal-lawsuit-alleging-blocked-thousands-minority-voters/4M2dMAHDRvC8fLYoV01fxN/). Then Kemp used it again.

Two, this method of purging due to inactivity is not automatic. It was initiated by Kemp in election year. And it's clearly a bad method, as its goal was to remove only voters that moved to other precincts and guess what? It didn't. Maybe not sending out a single small postcard to an address you don't think is correct is a better way to go, as these people routinely say they never got notice.

Three and finally, *you do not have to perform arbitrary nonfunctional and bad faith rituals to retain your fundamental rights*. Given the voting rate in the United States, *any* law that purges voters due to inactivity has to result in less voter registration. Voting is not mandatory, but it *is not a privilege, it is a right*.

Again, El would have you believe that Kemp, in the tightest race for governorship in the country, using methods that the State settled out of court and agreed it wouldn't use, in his own election, with the result of *hundreds of thousands of people* being purged for having moved when they did not move, is acting in good faith. It is, frankly, fucking absurd. 

El also claims this without providing evidence and by making provably false claims.","&gt;he SCOTUS did not confirm that our ""exact match' system was in compliance with the NVR Act because it never got to them.

I didn't say anything about exact match, sparky.  The article is about Georgia's purge law.  Try to keep up. 

&gt;Two, this method of purging due to inactivity is not automatic.

It actually is automatic - the clock started in 2013 - which was NOT an election year. 

&gt;And it's clearly a bad method, as its goal was to remove only voters that moved to other precincts

False

&gt;Maybe not sending out a single small postcard to an address you don't think is correct is a better way to go

You mean, the address on file and in public records? How else to contact the registrant, champ?

&gt;you do not have to perform arbitrary nonfunctional and bad faith rituals to retain your fundamental rights. 

So, what you're trying to say is that registrant MUST NOT be asked to ensure their information is up-to-date?  Ever?  

&gt;any law that purges voters due to inactivity has to result in less voter registration.

No shit. 

&gt;Voting is not mandatory, but it is not a privilege, it is a right.

And a right that relies on accurate public records. If a person doesn't take the time and effort to ensure his/her public records are correct, they have no room to bitch and moan about not being able to participate in an action that *requires* proof of individuality. It isn't that hard a concept. 

&gt;El also claims this without providing evidence and by making provably false claims.

The law prohibits purging people ""simply"" for failing to vote. The SCOTUS decision only allowed these purges to go through as a method of combating voter fraud. While this is virtually nonexistent in the first place, the only kind of mis-vote this process can curtail *are* those caused by people moving precincts.

Basically, the law only stands *if* its intent is to purge moved voters.
&gt;If the folks affected couldn't be bothered to vote or respond to written requests regarding their status for 12 years

The presumption among the defenders is that these people unilaterally got repeated notices that their vote was about to get purged and they just didn't do anything about it with it in the back of their mind for 7-12 years. In actuality, in most cases, it's that a single postcard uncertified notice went out, either got lost in the mail or didn't really get read, as many of these people on interview had no idea they were candidates for removal. 

When states want to contact or notify somebody for things like taxes, they do not send a single postcard notice. They send multiple certified mail requests, they make sincere efforts to notify. What these laws are crafted to do is the bare minimums to comply with the SCOTUS ruling *and* maximize the number of purged people.

Voter suppression laws can't be nakedly Jim Crow or poll-taxy as that obviously breaks SCOTUS rulings. But their intent is always to minimize eligible voters in a state.

I recently watched some old YouTube videos from the 60's of William F Buckley interviewing Allen Ginsberg, and man, you could not have a more cordial exchange between two people with polar opposite views of the world.

Funny that, people being tribal. Go figure.

I think part of the problem is that as living conditions have improved over the last 50 years and many societal issues were largely resolved to a satisfactory degree, the politics of both right and left had to become more extreme to differentiate themselves.

I don't doubt that humility is at the heart of good discourse, nor do I think it isn't at least a major part of being a moderate. I'm just sceptical of how helpful it is to talk about it in such terms. I think it might be partly a subtle difference between ""it's always good to be humble"", and ""moderates are always humble"". The latter is essentially what is being said in the article. It's a list of points about ""what moderates believe"", with ""humility is the fundamental virtue"" being one of them; the implication here is that that's unique to moderates, and therefore an insult to readers who wouldn't describe themselves as such.

As an analogy that I think you might understand well, think about sexual harassment. Now, an overwhelming proportion of sexual harassment cases are perpetrated against women. But is it actually helpful to frame the war against sexual harassment as an explicitly feminist thing? If you're convinced by ""sexual harassment against women is bad"", you'd just as easily be convinced by ""sexual harassment is bad"", full stop. All the former really adds is the danger of alienating men who would otherwise gladly denounce sexual harassment, but are put off by the women-first rhetoric attached to it. It's the same with this; you're not changing any additional minds by attributing humility to moderation instead of just encouraging it, but you are running the risk of alienating people.",6395,19,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics
"A: If I'm reading your comment right, it sounds like you're suggesting we advocate for the behavior that might be considered moderate (such as a willingness to listen and try to understand opposing ideas, act in good faith, or compromise) without attaching it to yet another label that causes people to resort to further tribalism. If I got that right, then I fully agree.

Behavior like what I had in the parentheses is what I think we should hold up as just the general standard for society. It should especially be the expected behavior for politicians. I think one of the bigger issues today is the attachment people make between their identity and political labels. There's less concern about actual ideas on policy and more focus on protecting one's own label or tarnishing the opposition.

Just look at discussions whenever there's a mass shooting. There's usually heavy focus on trying to label the shooter as a conservative/liberal followed by inane semantic debates on what makes someone a liberal or conservative. As if these are two clearly distinct groups with bold dividing lines that have been unchanged since the dawn of humanity. ","Your point on falling into a superiority trap is well taken and I would agree that it should be avoided. However, I would disagree with your claim that having moderate political beliefs isn't superior to being either hard left or right. if you classify yourself as either left or right you are most likely subscribing to a certain set of disconnected political beliefs that are set in stone. Believe the government is too large and bloated? Well then you most likely also believe that abortion should be illegal. But why? These things have nothing to do with each other and could even be argued are counter to each other. A moderate on the other hand, has a higher likelihood of thinking through individual issues and picking and choosing their positions based on sound reason rather than a particular dogma. So in that regard, I would argue there is a bit of intellectual superiority, but I would agree with you that it's counter-productive to beat people over the head with that fact. One could easily fall into a trap of saying, ""Well I'm a moderate and I've thought about all sides of the issue, therefore my position on any one particular topic must be the correct one."" I would agree that one should refrain from making such an erroneous conclusion.

He is discrediting any and every investigation conducted on any politician, especially those where a Democrat was not convicted and where a republican was convicted. So say the FBI starts investigating a certain money frail that goes from a foreign entity in to a 501c that makes its way to a republican candidate. If the FBI investigates that candidate and it leaks to the public, the opinion of the president is already out there and his supporters will automatically believe its a witch hunt because ""the FBI leadership is bias against Republicans"" when it very well could in fact be a foreign government throwing money in our elections. What if a Democrat is accused of the same thing but there's no evidence of it? If the FBI doesn't publicly disclose their investigation of it or refused to, the whole ""see they're biased!"" can be dragged out. 
 
That's the real fucked up part. The FBI can't do its job unless it's easy on Republicans and harsh on democrats. I wonder if this will stop at politicians and not trickle down to individuals being investigated and they won't be asked or have their political activity researched.

"B: [31,000 SCIENTISTS REJECT 'GLOBAL WARMING' AGENDA]( http://www.wnd.com/2008/05/64734/)

Perhaps the strongest argument against an appreciable human contribution to climate patterns comes from the observed cooling that took place between 1940 and 1975, and the lack of warming since 1979 (in the weather balloon and satellite data).

The Earth's climate has never been steady; it has either warmed or cooled -- without any human intervention -- since the dawn of time. The measured variations have often been larger and more rapid than those currently predicted by climate models for the year 2100. In the last 3,000 years, temperatures in the North Atlantic have changed by as much as 3°C within a few decades.","That petition is really old and to my knowledge was debunked years ago:

&gt; If you're a woman and voted for Trump, well, you're not a feminist. And at some point, our society has to accept that that's not necessarily a bad thing.

These two sentences need to be taken together. The crucial word here is the ""that"" in ""that's not necessarily a bad thing"". What does the word ""that"" refer to? Now, you seem to have taken the meaning that ""that"" refers to ""all women have to vote Democrat to be a real woman"". You'll notice, however, that that never appeared in my comment. Instead, I feel it's reasonably clear that the ""that"" refers to the phrase: ""you're not a feminist"".

I'm saying that it's *not a bad thing if you're not a feminist*.

So in answer to your first two questions, no, of course I don't think it's a sexist or hypocritical statement, because I'm not making any moral judgements on women who aren't feminists (if you mean Michelle, then actually, yes, it's not a great statement, but I'm going to refer to that in the other comment). And no, I'm not ""arguing that all women have to vote Democrat to be a real woman"". I have no concept of ""real woman""; every woman is a ""real woman"". If anything, I'm arguing that women can vote for anyone they want, as you can see from my previous quote, ""they live very happy lives and we shouldn't be trying to force them into something they don't want.""

&gt; If you want to be a quiet, traditional, family woman, that's your right; but you inevitably screw over countless other women by voting against Hillary.

You'll notice, once again, that I have not made any moral judgements on the ""quiet, traditional, family woman"". Nor has the word ""real"" come up in this quote, or really any quote I made. I'm saying that the ""quiet, traditional, family women"", aka the women more likely to vote Trump, are screwing over other women, aka the women more likely to vote Hillary, and you'll notice that there's no moral judgement over who's ""in the right"" there; it's an objective fact. This objectivity is portrayed further when I make the parallel claim, that those who vote Hillary are screwing over those who vote Trump, in the second half of that paragraph that you conveniently forgot to quote.

I believe the problem may be that when I said the word ""feminist"", your mind automatically substituted that with ""real women"". That's a shame, because I did try to define ""feminist"" properly and objectively: hence the quote, ""women who don't want to sit down, shut up and obey their men; that's what the feminist movement is all about."" That is to say, there is a specific subset of women in the world who are ""feminists"", and that therefore there are also many women who aren't feminists. Once again, just to drill this in, at no point do I make any moral judgements about either. Both feminists and non-feminists are ""real women"". I don't blame you for this mistake; too often, we do hear feminists use the word ""feminist"" morally, and imply that non-feminists are morally inferior. In fact, in context, Michelle is doing this to a significant extent. I, however, am not. For you to assume that I am is not productive to the discussion.

So there you go, I hope I cleared up what I was talking about. Sorry to be handling you with kid gloves on this topic, but I do believe that your reply was driven by a complete breakdown of understanding between us, and so I had to explain the semantics of my post to remedy that. I hope that's the case, because the alternative is that you're being intentionally disingenuous in your reply, in which case there's little we can really do to have a discussion.",1649,32,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics

That's the thing. Often times science finds out stuff that is counter intuitive. Like evolution. People personally don't feel like apes are their ancestors and build up a huge resistance.

But there are a number of very interesting scientific findings. And one of the market failure categories I linked to is ""information asymmetrie"", which plays a much bigger role these days, when the basic stuff we buy is much more complex to understand. You can't even buy [bread these days](http://rt.com/news/monsanto-rats-tumor-france-531/) without taking serious risks. That was quite different a hundred or even fifty years ago.

Other people might shop at derpmart, because it makes them feel good, or their cousin works there or whatever. Even though they make inferior products. Or give shitty service. End result: Free market does not promote best products. Or best service. Or best anything. Because of many, many reasons. One is that people don't even seek out the best for themselves. Because they are not selfish. Another would be that they don't know what is best, because of market failure.

Either way, you don't get the best result with a free market. Maybe not even a good one. Perhaps even the worst. But I guess you said it best two answers ago:

&gt; The basic premise behind free market theory is that people act in their own **rational** self interest.

&gt; The whole free market ideology is premised on the idea that there isn't even a meaningful definition of the word **""rational""**

"A: &gt;That's just two sentences apart. Boom goes the ideology of free market. Byebye

I don't think you get the point I was trying to make. i'm not saying there isn't a such thing as rational. I'm just saying it's pointless to try and measure it scientifically. Rational isn't an objective term. Each person has their own idea of what it means. I think certain things are rational as I'm sure you do. Your response however when someone does something that you don't think is rational, is to chalk that up as some sort of market failure. You say ""how can those people eat at that restaurant"" or ""don't they know that company is bad for the environment, why do they shop there"". 

&gt;Either way, you don't get the best result with a free market.

What does that even mean? Who get's to say what best even means? Just because you don't like the outcome, doesn't mean it's therefore objectively bad. ","&gt; I'm just saying it's pointless to try and measure it scientifically.

I am not trying to do that. 

&gt; as some sort of market failure

I have a strong feeling that you seem to disregard the concept of market failure, which has become pretty basic economics these days. It's about as proven as free market theory. As anything economic can be proven. Or not, as it turns out. 

&gt; company is bad for the environment

That would fall under external effects.

&gt; What does that even mean? Who get's to say what best even means? Just because you don't like the outcome, doesn't mean it's therefore objectively bad. 

That's an interesting thought. You see, I believe there is an objective better and worse. For example: If I can, right now, make €10 profit by killing a million people or a €5 profit by doing something that won't kill them, I believe one of them is objectively surperior. Unlimited free markets and a sociopath (which is pretty much what happened in 2008) beg to differ. And you can go less than my grossly overstated example to ""putting 10 tons of CO2 in the air"" vs. ""putting 2 tons of CO2 in the air"". I am just talking about external effects right now. Which is just one example of market failure. Completely independent of the others (like information asymmetry). Because there is not one market failure, but several. And my critic of unbound free markets doesn't stop with market failure. Though I am leaving proven economic ground in that. So I will leave it with market failure for now.

Sure they threaten regularly, but that's bluster that can be safely ignored. What does need to be considered is whether the leadership thinks the regime faces an existential threat. If they do, they will be more likely to escalate a situation that would otherwise be resolved without bloodshed.

You seem to think being ""concerned about their feelings"" is some sort of weakness. In reality, considering the motives and point of view of an adversary is helpful in containing or eventually diffusing a threat. It's how you form a strategy instead of just stumbling around the world stage waving a big loaded weapon.

Edit: South Koreans seem unimpressed with Trump in general. He had a [17% approval rating in South Korea in November](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/03/opinions-in-asian-countries-on-trump-trip/), a 71 percentage point drop since Obama in 2015.","&gt; Sure it's a crappy situation, but it's a crappy situation that hasn't produced open warfare since the 1950's.

It sounds like you believe the only solution is to remain a hostage like this forever.

Only now - they have Nukes instead of just artillery.

&gt;Sure they threaten regularly, but that's bluster that can be safely ignored. 

So we can ignore the bluster sometimes, but fear it other times?

&gt;You seem to think being ""concerned about their feelings"" is some sort of weakness. 

No. I think that insisting our only option is to forever live in fear of the bully is weakness. In reality, every time you cower when the bully threatens you - the bully is emboldened to threaten you more. In this instance, we have also given the bully 70 years to bread a human population designed to worship him like a god and kill their own friends and family.

It's how he (and his dad and his dad's dad and their generals) has formed a strategy of defeating an overwhelmingly more advanced military. By holding South Korea hostage, and now they want to expand that strategy to holding the world hostage.

How exactly has waiting for 70 years helped the situation? You keep saying "" hasn't produced open warfare "". So we should just wait until it does, or they skip the shelling part and go right to the nuke?

&gt;Edit: South Koreans seem unimpressed with Trump in general

I'm not arguing to be pro-trump, or that trump is popular. I'm arguing the lunacy of modern foreign policy that has created North Korea and the threat they are today.

How does North Korea change? Or do we instead resign ourselves to a world that always has a North Korea?

These are more the questions I am discussing. And I don't see how another 70 years of the foreign policy we have had will change North Korea. If anything, giving them more time hurts us because they develop their technology and breed a race of human being that will execute family and friends who just want to leave and go to the outside world and never comeback.

No telling for sure, but if we keep ignoring him, he is just going to sit there all night, getting drunker and harassing the honest patrons. I don't like/support Trump. I just get bored and like to play devil's advocate... and make bar analogies. ","Let's go line by line on Trump's tweet, shall we?

“North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the ‘Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times,’”

&gt;This is, indeed, true. I do find it strange that the media didn't treat this as warmongering the way they treat Trump's response. In fact, no one seems to be paying attention to the fact that Trump's tweet is a RESPONSE to Kim Jong Un flippantly implying that he could nuke a major regional US ally, or the US proper, for that matter, and are instead treating Trump like this is a completely unwarranted declaration of intent to nuke Best Korea.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/…/kim-jong-un-warns-us-north-ko…/

“Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime""

&gt;This is also true. North Korea is a resource-depleted country that has experienced generation-long famines due to failed Communist policies. The only source of meat for the civilians lucky enough to have them are dogs, which are farmed specifically for food. Much rarer, to the point of irrelevance, are pigs. Cows are forbidden from being eaten, because they produce more effective labor than people (because this is a country that still uses cows as agricultural equipment) and so killing a cow is a capital crime. Resources are so depleted that Best Korea must resort to illegally importing oil from China and Russia, and the food supply is spread so thin that widespread malnutrition has lead to the average Nork being 1 to 3 inches shorter than the average South Korean.

""please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button,""

&gt;Trump does indeed have a button on his desk, but it's a button that tells an attendant to bring him two diet cokes. Nuclear Launch protocols are much more complex, and the process is initiated by a phone call (He does, and we've confirmed this as well, have a phone at his desk.) So the ""Nuclear Button"" is a metaphor for the nuclear capability of each country, as we will see from the rest of the tweet.

http://time.com/4758059/donald-trump-coke-nuclear-button/

""but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his,""

&gt;In regards to our nuclear arsenal, this is true. The maximum yield estimates of Best Korean nuclear tests have capped out at 250 kilotons of TNT (1,000 TJ), and the most liberal estimates as to their strategic arsenal are that they have at most, 60 deliverable nuclear warheads.

&gt;Compare that to the US, which has 6,800 nuclear and thermonuclear missiles, with yields of up to, and usually standardized at, 1.2 megatons of TNT (5020.8 TJ) (Note: We've made FAAAR more powerful thermonukes, we just also recognize the sweet spots of effectiveness for using them and the appropriate payloads)

""and my Button works!”

&gt;Also true. North Korea has had numerous, high-publicity (from a Western media standpoint) test failures regarding their missile program. Last April, they even destroyed part of one of their own cities with a failed missile test. Whereas US missile testing has a much, much higher and more consistent success rate.

SOOOOOOO all-in-all... Trump's right about everything in this tweet, is using it to troll Kim Jong Un into realizing how completely outmatched he is in the nuclear war he keeps threatening the US with in the hopes of receiving aid, sanction relief, and political recognition such as all of the times previous administrations have capitulated to him in the past whenever he or his dad has tried this shit, and Trump's strategic, though shitposter-ish, rebuttal of Kim Jung Un's posturing has lead to North Korea requesting to re-establish communications with South Korea.

4 months ago was not April of 2017. And while it may not have impacted their work, it certainly shows Mark Warner acting strange.

Why didn't he tell everyone else in April, when he was texting to meet with Steele? Probably the same reason he was so giddy and hopeful that some dudes in the Ukraine were going to give him naked pictures of Trump.

What has he done that has been so beneficial to Russia? No sanctions have been reversed, the world talks more about hating Putin now than they did at any time in the last 8 years...

Aside from the ""win"" in the sense that the entire world now seems to claim Putin is a mastermind who has lead Russia to the defeat of the United States... for almost a year now this is a constant news story - which would be an even more dramatic claim if he suddenly lays out all kinds of evidence of collusion, and Trump is impeached, arrested, etc!

Why wait?

What has Trump given Russia? Nothing has changed since Obama in Syria, Ukraine, economic policy...

So wouldn't Putin exposing how he punked the world now be just as good as later? By showing Trump really is his puppet, wouldn't that be the best play for Putin and Russia?

If the FBI or CIA or NSA are the ones to ""Figure it out"" first, isn't that bad for Putin and Russia? Wouldn't it be more powerful if they were the ones to reveal it?

&gt;By not releasing it, he could still hold it over Trump in situations where Trump does have a say on what to do.

This seems to be proven untrue, if all congress needs to do is over-ride or pass legislation.

But I do agree with the first part - having dirt is having dirt and does have that advantage of blackmail...

It just also seems to me that the absolute chaos that a revelation like that would cause in the US at this moment in time would be something the US has not seen in modern history. So the benefit of playing the card while it has that value seems like a better ""move"" for Putin if Trump is Putin's Puppet.

Especially if Mueller and the FBI and CIA and NSA and Justice department are just about to make their move and break the whole case open to the world, gnome sane?

And of course, if Trump is in fact Putin's puppet - what does Putin care about holding it out long term over Trump? How does it get better than the chaos, for Putin?","I would argue that Putin's goal is a general discrediting of the USA a the ""leader of the free world"" rather than any particular financial or political goal.

- Subsidized College loans.  Ostensibly this is like a mini-GI bill, broad based, to encourage people of lesser means to get a college education.  We say that the world is information driven, that people will have a better chance to participate as productive citizens, if they are educated. Beyond which, a liberal education means a more stable populace, a more civil society. All good right?  

But then they made college loans untouchable in bankruptcy.  This means college loans are worth more than any other loan.  Not all loans are created equal. College tuition loans are untouchable, immortal.  In its wisdom the law allows crushing debt to be dispensed via bankruptcy, but not college loans.  And the logical consequence of that is that the cost of college will skyrocket. College costs go up, because of the economic law of subsidy: subsidizing anything makes it more expensive. The loans themselves are a subsidy, but the fact that they are not dismissable in bankrupcty is an extraordinary subsidy.  

- Subsidized corn. Sure, we need a secure food supply. But is the best way to do that, handing out billions of dollars to Monsanto and other mega corporations? Honestly? We subsidized corn ethanol for 30 years, when as long as 20 years ago it became very clear that the economics were upside down. And yet the congress continued handing out money. 

- Obama's Healthcare reform. What people really need is quality healthcare for a reasonable cost, but because of corporate influence in the congress, we got a system that essentially continues the status quo, and is not funded to deliver the benefits we wanted. 

- Bush's Medicare Prescription Drug benefit. A giant giveaway to old people in exchange for votes. We couldn't afford this when it was proposed, and we still can't.

- Iraq. Sure, we want global security, but invading a country and destroying all the infrastructure?  Essentially we paid people to blow crap up, then paid the same people to rebuild it.  The US military excursion into Iraq, aside from all the deaths of innocent people, has been a huge boondoggle for defense contractors and military consultants, Iraq is what President Eisenhower apochryphally warned us about when he decried the ""military industrial complex"" in his farewell address.

"B: &gt;the economic law of subsidy: subsidizing anything makes it more expensive

Wait, really? I thought subsidies were supposed to make prices go down for consumers.

Damn, economics, you scary.","yes really.

Subsidies are a form of market interference.  Sometimes they lower the cost to consumers. Sometimes they raise the cost to consumers.  Sometimes they are neutral to consumers.  But in all cases, subsidy raises the *net cost* for the subsidized good.  When I use the term subsidy, it refers to any kind of subsidy.

One form of subsidy is a tariff. For example, there's a tax on sugar imported from Brazil to the USA.  For real.  For every 100 lbs of sugar, the US government charges the importer, let's say, $10.  I don't know the actual number, but I know there's a real subsidy. Using our fake number, it means the seller/importer has to charge $10 more for that 100lbs of sugar, to make the same profit. In other words the tariff increases the net cost of the imported sugar. 

This is a form of subsidy for sugar produced domestically, in the USA.  Obviously this form of subsidy does not make sugar cheaper for consumers, right?  It makes imported sugar more expensive, and it thus allows domestic sugar to be priced higher, because it does not need to compete with the naturally cheaper imported sugar. So the effect of this subsidy is to make all sugar (imported as well as domestic) more expensive for everyone. 

Another form of subsidy is government assistance for purchases.  Think of subsidized government housing, available to lower-income people. If a person takes advantage of that subsidized housing, *they pay less for housing* than they might otherwise. On the other hand, the net cost of the housing goes up.  That's because the total cost is what the consumer pays, plus what the government pays.  The owner of the subsidized housing gets more money for the rental unit than he would in a completely free market, for the same property.  The full net cost of the subsidized good (rental housing) is not transmitted to the direct consumer; instead the extra cost is picked up by the taxpayer. Some portion of their taxes goes to paying the higher cost of the subsidized rent. net cost: up.  consumer cost: down. 

Another kind of subsidy is cheap money - subsidized loans that can be used only for particular purposes. FNMA and FMAC did this for housing loans.  The federally-supported school loans do this for college tuition.  The effect is that the ""cost of money"" to be used for a particular purpose is lower than it otherwise would be. One effect is that the thing being purchased is more accessible - more people can buy a house, or more people can go to college. But, another effect is that the cost of the thing being purchased with cheaper money - the house or the college tuition - goes up. There is more money chasing the same resource - houses or admission spots at Stanford - so the price of that good naturally goes up.  

Government-subsidized school loans allow more people to go to college, but the net cost of a college education goes up, as compared to a hypothetical free market, in which there are no govt-supported loans available. 

The other subsidy affecting college tuition loans is their exclusion from dismissal in bankruptcy.  That is a huge subsidy, which makes the book value of the loan much, much higher than it would be. Think of it this way: people default on some percentage of loans .  For argument's sake, let's say 1% of loans don't get paid back. This is a risk to lenders, and they use this credit default rate to figure the interest to charge for all loans.  The interest has to be enough to make up for expected losses from loan defaults. 

But the default rate for school loans is by law, 0%.  You cannot default. You cannot ever dismiss the loan.  So that means a loan of $10,000 for school tuition, is worth a lot more to a bank, than a loan of $10,000, in the form of a credit card balance, which can be dismissed in bankruptcy.  The fact that the loans never default encourages more lending for school loans; according to supply and demand, more school loan money pushes the cost of tuition up. 

----

Another form of subsidy - government payouts for particular things. Funny story: at one time the US Government established a policy to eliminate wolves from Yellowstone National Park. So what did they do?  They offered $10 per head of each wolf killed. Bring in a wolf head, get $10.  Bring in ten heads, get $100.  Guess what happened?  The population of wolves in the park skyrocketed.  Why?  Because what used to be worthless - the head of a dead wolf - was now worth $10.  This can be thought of as a direct subsidy for wolf heads.  Obviously the cost for wolf heads went up - from zero to $10.  And incidentally, because of the increased value (or price) of wolf heads, people began to raise wolves for profit, which means the population of wolves went up.  Oops.

**TL;DR**: Subsidy for a thing always increases the net cost of a thing, though that cost may not be passed directly to the consumer of the thing.  

- In the particular case of government-subsidized school loans, the effect is to increase the cost of a college education *for everyone,* whether they use a government-subsidized loan to pay for college or not. 

- In the particular case of subsidized home loans, the cost of a house goes up for everyone.  

- In the case of sugar tariffs, the cost of sugar goes up for everyone.  

- In the case of subsidized low-income rental housing, the cost of housing goes down for the consumer of the subsidized housing, and up for everyone else (via taxes).

"C: I personally think it has a lot to do with the connotation people simply have in their heads with the words they hear, and being a liberal has been denigrated for quite some time and even the liberals and progressives tend to shy away from being called such.

There's certainly plenty of distrust in the government and liberals are the de facto supporters of an active, robust government role in society, but when the framing of these basic terms such as conservative and liberal are established as almost being good and bad, realistic and naive, productive vs consumptive, people will naturally identify themselves as being the more positively identified term.  

I've also noticed it can be more difficult to articulate an effective point for liberal or progressive ideals or values, as they seem to stem from results of a purely values-based system of operation, seeking to correct a problem from the current status quo.  So there's layers to being able to communicate this message effectively to people who might not be thinking about it, such as first establishing a common value or system that is agreed upon.  Then move onto a potential pitfall of having such a simplistic view of that system, perhaps a method of exploiting it.  State how a mechanism might work to prevent or mitigate the damage done by this corruption of the system, and that a purely voluntary basis of participation of those operating in this system is not workable(such as those people not participating in this preventive measure are at a competitive advantage to those participating), and that therefore a law or policy must be established to either encourage or compel entities to adhere to this preventive measure.  State this is a possible approach to progressive/liberal thought and query how that is evil or stupid, and ask for input on how to prevent that being corrupted somehow.","&gt;being a liberal has been denigrated for quite some time and even the liberals and progressives tend to shy away from being called such

This is true, and I wonder how it became this way so easily. I believe that there is a slightly leftist bias in media (because it's a field that traditionally requires more education), so it's curious that the term ""liberal"" has such a negative connotation.

&gt;as they seem to stem from results of a purely values-based system of operation

I don't think this is necessarily a fair assessment of liberal vs. conservative ideas. I think most genuine political opinions stem from value systems, but when you get down to the bone of an argument sometimes it's the ONLY difference. For example, we *know* that socially and statistically, abortions are a ""good thing"". They result lower crime, give a safer environment for abortions that would happen anyway, and have the potential to save the lives of mothers with pregnancy complications. Why then, is there opposition to abortion? It's because some people value human life - even at an illogical stage of its existence - enough to ignore facts. My own discomfort with the morality of abortion stems from things other than its proven viability to society.

There's a difference between the freedom to abort a fetus, and establishing policies that demand participation by force. To defeat a law against abortion, all I have to do is prove that someone should be free to make a decision. To create a powerful (if not efficient) social safety net, I must not only demonstrate that it will be effective, but I must also compel someone who gains much less from a measure to support it with their livelihood. Those are the ""layers"" you're talking about, not the idea that only liberals have a correct sense of morality.",45,57,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics
"A: I agree that I probably glossed over some in my description of the two general directions of ideas in liberals and conservatives, though I disagree that all one has to do to defeat a law against abortion, for example, is to demonstrate it's effectiveness.  Besides the most fundamental view of thinking it shouldn't be allowed on the basis of it being immoral, the sometimes implied and sometimes outright idea of there being women who have multitudes of abortions underscores an idea that proponents of abortion are reckless in their sexual habits and are deferring their responsibility to both their baby as well as the state, costing both of those entities while enabling the woman who got the abortion to go out and continue behaving in the way they have been.  Especially in areas that identify very strongly with traditional values, these chip away and distract from the realities that those getting the procedure may very well not be in a financial or otherwise position to properly raise a child, may not be healthy enough to carry to term, or the oft-touted examples, while hopefully very rare in the overall number of abortions, rape victims.

On the hand, a social safety net could theoretically be proven with simply appealing to one's sense of equitability and charity if it is done in a way that appeals to the listener, but this is unlikely given the complexities of that argument as well.

I didn't mean to imply that only liberals have a correct sense of morality, and I apologize if it came off as high-handed or elitist because saying only one 'side' has a correct sense of morality is, indeed, a way of demonstrating some level of arrogance in one's own position.  What I meant to say in the progression part of my post was simply to engage with someone of a differing position so as to establish some common points of agreement and then to discuss how those commonalities break down on other points of discussion.  It very well may not, and probably won't lead to someone changing their opinion on things, but what it more likely can do will at least expose this person to a differing point of view in a way that is less offensive than having that same opinion misrepresented or caricatured by a person who actually doesn't even hold that opinion(such as, say, individuals like Glenn Beck or Sean Hannity presuming to speak for the values, motivations and goals of liberals or Keith Olbermann and Ed Schultz stating they know what lies in the hearts of conservatives).  Having an honest, nonaggressive exchange of ideas will better serve the participants than an increasingly tense atmosphere of arguing and attempting to establish superiority of morality or facts(which often can be taken out of context to be leveraged to one end or another).  It also, to me, fosters the sort of civil exchange of ideas, even if and especially if those involved don't come to agreement because a tenant of our representative systems is that we decide our current events and political disagreements with one another, not by ignoring and demonizing one another.  If it were not so, then why even establish a system which, at base, deals with having to contend with individuals of differing opinions?","&gt;I believe that there is a slightly leftist bias in media (**because it's a field that traditionally requires more education)**, so it's curious that the term ""liberal"" has such a negative connotation.

"B: &gt;A) this is correlational evidence, not causational. This distinction is very important.

I agree but I am unclear as to what you think this means. Does this mean we cannot use these studies to make an informed decision on gun control? Does this mean that the studies are correct but all it tell us is that these two things occurred at the same time and they have no or a very small relationship?

&gt;B) Even by proving the point of ""more guns do not stop more crimes"", this does not prove or give any real evidence to ""less guns do stop more crimes"", just anecdotal, correlational evidence.

The articles discuss studies that suggest that homes with guns had an increased risk of violence and suicide. I don't think it proves that fewer guns stop crime but that if you are around a gun the chances of being involved a crime that includes death increases.

&gt;The belief that more guns lead to fewer crimes is founded on the idea that guns are dangerous when bad guys have them, so we should get more guns into the hands of good guys. Yet Cook, the Duke economist, says this good guy/bad guy dichotomy is a false and dangerous one. Even upstanding American citizens are only human—they can “lose their temper, or exercise poor judgment, or misinterpret a situation, or have a few drinks,” he explains, and if they're carrying guns when they do, bad things can ensue. In 2013 in Ionia, Mich., a road rage incident led two drivers—both concealed carry permit holders—to get out of their cars, take out their guns and kill each other.

What did you think of this claim made in the article? Does the mix of accessible guns and alcohol/drugs play a role in these numbers? If we remove all the people who were high/drunk when they committed violent acts with guns do you think it would show that sober people make good choice with weapons even when they get emotionally upset?

&gt;And regardless of either of those points, if your goal is to stop crimes, and you believe getting rid of guns will help this, how will you make the population of Americans who want to have guns give them up? Will you perhaps advocate the use of force by police officers carrying guns?

&gt;And regardless of either of those points, if your goal is to stop crimes, and you believe getting rid of guns will help this, 

I don't think the suggestion is that we need to get rid of all guns. I think we need to have a honest discussion about who should have access to guns (all of the varieties available) and what types of modifications we should allow to be legal. I think we need a way to ensure those who have shown signs of recent mental issues cannot purchase military style firearms and maybe have to get permission from a guardian to be able to purchase other weapons. I don't really have all the answers on this issue but I think there is a path forward that enables most people to be able to legally purchase most weapons and still restrict those who have demonstrated unstable, criminal or terrorist behavior should be denied or have to wait much longer.

&gt;how will you make the population of Americans who want to have guns give them up? Will you perhaps advocate the use of force by police officers carrying guns?

This just seems alarmist to me. I have not heard anyone suggest that we need to force responsible gun owners to give up their legally owned weapons. I am sure that are some politicians out there that is saying this and I disagree with them. In my view the discussion is more about those who are abusing their right to own weapons than those who do it responsibly. We need to be discussing how to make it harder for some people without making it overly burdensome for majority of responsible gun owners out there. 

edit: grammar 
","In the event of trying to totally ban guns- I'd say deal with the already existing ones through buybacks and just wait it out. Over time with new guns being harder to get the number of total guns will go down. Many old guns will become unusable, not be maintained properly, be lost, be destroyed purposely by criminals b/c they are evidence or by law enforcement when they are discovered in a crime. Over time more will be sold as gun collections are passed on to people who would rather take some money, so as long as buybacks buy some of those guns for sale, and as long as laws make it so that getting a gun is prohibitively expensive and time consuming, the amount of guns will reduce over time without having to harass people with cops at every door.",2343,3,1,subreddit-moderatepolitics
"C: &gt;Only 9,616 were murders the rest were mostly suicides with a few accidents. Source FBI Expanded Homicide Data Table 8. That is some misleading shit. Suicidal people are still going to kill them selves or attempt to with or with out a gun.

This is categorically [not true](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-guns-in-home-increase-suicide-homicide-risk/). There is a reason why people choose guns for suicide, because the effect is instant, your body can't simply throw up a bullet, and it is much more immediate which means you have less chance to second-guess yourself. When you bring a gun into your home, it increases the risk of someone dying, *including yourself*.
&gt;So the gun murder per capita rate has significantly decreased over that 20 year period from 3.93 per 100,000 to 3.4 in 2016 (2.99 in 2015 the year in the article).

As all crime has decreased in the last 20 years, we would expect the gun numbers to go down. Instead, they have lagged behind the fall of other crimes' numbers, which is the point.
&gt;The Florida spree shooter was reported to 3 different government agencies before he attacked. The government systems in place failed miserably so how do more laws and more government help?

The laws failed because of people unwilling to enforce them. You think a young black male convicted on a minimum sentence of carrying marijuana gets the same leniency as a middle aged white guy buying a gun? People just assume it isn't a big deal, even though categorically and unequivocally white men commit the overwhelming amount of mass shooting incidents in this country, while black and white men consume relatively equal amounts of marijuana.
&gt;If a person has made their mind up to commit murder making it slightly harder to buy a gun won't stop them.

I mean if you can tell me how someone can sit up in a hotel half a mile away and snipe people with a van or knife I'm all ears.","&gt;Current and proposed bans on ""assault rifles"" and magazine capacity are useless.

I disagree with this assertion that they are useless. Can you please explain why you think this to be the case?

&gt;I am all for background checks on secondary transfers as is most of our country. The article quoted 85% of Americans. However, all spree shooter legally passed a back ground check or stole their gun from family. This will not reduce spree shooters.

I think that background checks can and probably do help reduce spree shootings. I do not think the current system is perfect but I think it stops some people. 

&gt;I am for a mental health disqualification from owning firearms but it must be a court mandated appearance not tried in abstention like the no fly list. Additionally this will require massive revisions of our health care and rights to privacy laws, including HIPPA.

I don't think disqualification is the right answer, I just think it should be harder. Maybe if you have had a mental health problem in the last 6 months you have to wait an additional 30 days or have a guardian sign off on the purchase. If you think the standard should be court mandated appearance then I think this would be a meaningless to stopping people. I guess the problem here is that if the bar is too low you stop to many people, but if you make it too hard then very few of the afflicted people will every get this certification so it will have little to no impact.

&gt;&gt;""Guns took more than 36,000 U.S. lives in 2015, and this and other alarming statistics have led many to ask whether our nation would be better off with firearms in fewer hands. ""

&gt;Only 9,616 were murders the rest were mostly suicides with a few accidents. Source FBI Expanded Homicide Data Table 8. That is some misleading shit. 

In my view this conversation is not strictly about murders. The way I see it, when someone with mental health problems kills themselves or other people I think we should ask the question: Should we have let them purchase the weapon? If remove all the suicides from our discussion then we restrict our ability to try and stop a large number of deaths from occurring. 

&gt;Suicidal people are still going to kill them selves or attempt to with or with out a gun.

I don't believe this to be true, at least all of the time.

&gt; I have a major problem with this opening statistic, as suicides and murders should be looked at very differently.

I don't disagree that it would be useful to look at these things separately but nothing about including them together diminishes the information or conclusions presented in this article. 

&gt;I find it interesting the article doesn't quote gun murder statistics. Between 1997 to 2016 (as far as FBI statistics are listed online) total gun murders have ranged from 8,454 to 11,004. They don't follow a general pattern rising and falling several times in that 20 year period. However population of the US has greatly increased in that time, 272 million in 1997 to 323 million in 2016. So the gun murder per capita rate has significantly decreased over that 20 year period from 3.93 per 100,000 to 3.4 in 2016 (2.99 in 2015 the year in the article). Additionally, the number of firearms owned by private citizens has greatly increased during this time. NICS back ground checks for purchases of new firearms have gone from 9,138,123 in 1999 (earliest year listed online) to 27,538,673 in 2017. So there are more guns than ever before, higher population than ever before, but your chance of being murdered by a gun is decreasing steadily.

I think you want this article to be more narrowly focused then it actually is. I don't think think makes this article wrong or deceptive. I am going to assume that all of your numbers are correct. What do these numbers tell us about how to stop spree shootings in the US?

&gt;So I believe that this article intentionally misleads the reader in to assuming gun violence is growing, when gun murders per capita is shrinking. And this article seeks to conflate gun deaths (36,000 in 2015) with gun homicides (9,616 in 2015).

I don't think the author of the article claims that gun violence is growing in general. The article says:

&gt;But even as the belief that we are all future crime targets has taken hold, violent crime rates have actually dropped in the U.S. in recent decades. According to the FBI, rates were a whopping 41 percent lower in 2015 than they were in 1996. The NRA attributes this decrease to the acquisition of more guns. But that is misleading. What has increased is the number of people who own multiple guns—the actual number of people and households who own them has substantially dropped.

So the article acknowledges that violent crime rates have dropped in the US. It does suggest, as shown below, that states that have tried to make it easier for people to use their weapons in self deference have had increases in their homicide rates.

&gt;Recently researchers have tried to assess the value of self-defense gun use by studying “stand your ground” laws, which gained notoriety after teenager Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012. These laws allow people to kill in self-defense when they feel they are in danger. Progun groups argue that they should deter crime because criminals will know that victims have no reason not to fight back. But a January 2017 study reported that when “stand your ground” was passed in Florida, the monthly homicide rate went up by nearly a quarter. And a 2012 study found that states that adopted these laws experienced an abrupt and sustained 8 percent increase in homicides relative to other states. Mark Hoekstra, a co-author of the 2012 paper and an economist at Texas A&amp;M University, put it this way: “We found that making it easier to kill people resulted in more dead people.”

Mark Hoekstra, a co-author of the 2012 paper and an economist at Texas A&amp;M University, put it this way: “We found that making it easier to kill people resulted in more dead people.”

So the article claims that certain states have seen increases their in homicides after changing their laws to allow for more freedom to use weapons to in self defense, but on a national level violent crime has dropped.

&gt;The second part being very important because we have many laws that aren't currently enforced and safety protocols that aren't followed. The Florida spree shooter was reported to 3 different government agencies before he attacked. The government systems in place failed miserably so how do more laws and more government help?

I have heard this claim but I really don't know what this means. What laws are not being enforced and why are we not enforcing them? 

I think the questions should be how effective is our current system at stopping the sale of guns to people who have shown signs of intent to commit suicide or homicide. Can we stop more of these people while at the same time not stop people who have no such problems?

This is never going to be a perfect system that stops everyone all the time. If we can improve it to stop just a few more people then I think it is worth it.


&gt;If a person has made their mind up to commit murder making it slightly harder to buy a gun won't stop them. 

There is no such thing as a perfect system that stops every bad person but approves every good person. I just think we can improve on the system we have a bit. Realistically many people steal or own weapons prior to becoming mentally unstable. These rules won[t stop those people. I don't think this means we should not talk about improvements to the current system.

&gt;TL:DR We can discuss useful policy but this article conflates and misrepresents multiple issues involving firearms.

I think this article is broadly focused on guns and violence. I agree it could use better sourcing but I don't think is misrepresents or conflates the issues of murder and all gun violence. I would be open to continuing this discussion with another article of your choice. Maybe you can find one that is a bit more focus on the issue of murders rather than all gun violence. I do think that when we talk about changing the laws to restrict purchase to people with demonstrated signs of mental issues that we should include suicides in the discussion.

"A: &gt;Current and proposed bans on ""assault rifles"" and magazine capacity are useless.

I disagree with this assertion that they are useless. Can you please explain why you think this to be the case?

&gt;I am all for background checks on secondary transfers as is most of our country. The article quoted 85% of Americans. However, all spree shooter legally passed a back ground check or stole their gun from family. This will not reduce spree shooters.

I think that background checks can and probably do help reduce spree shootings. I do not think the current system is perfect but I think it stops some people. 

&gt;I am for a mental health disqualification from owning firearms but it must be a court mandated appearance not tried in abstention like the no fly list. Additionally this will require massive revisions of our health care and rights to privacy laws, including HIPPA.

I don't think disqualification is the right answer, I just think it should be harder. Maybe if you have had a mental health problem in the last 6 months you have to wait an additional 30 days or have a guardian sign off on the purchase. If you think the standard should be court mandated appearance then I think this would be a meaningless to stopping people. I guess the problem here is that if the bar is too low you stop to many people, but if you make it too hard then very few of the afflicted people will every get this certification so it will have little to no impact.

&gt;&gt;""Guns took more than 36,000 U.S. lives in 2015, and this and other alarming statistics have led many to ask whether our nation would be better off with firearms in fewer hands. ""

&gt;Only 9,616 were murders the rest were mostly suicides with a few accidents. Source FBI Expanded Homicide Data Table 8. That is some misleading shit. 

In my view this conversation is not strictly about murders. The way I see it, when someone with mental health problems kills themselves or other people I think we should ask the question: Should we have let them purchase the weapon? If remove all the suicides from our discussion then we restrict our ability to try and stop a large number of deaths from occurring. 

&gt;Suicidal people are still going to kill them selves or attempt to with or with out a gun.

I don't believe this to be true, at least all of the time.

If these provisions cut the number of return visits to the ER by even a modest amount, the savings could be HUGE.  Only time will tell if they are, but this kind of push for better care and less re-admissions is just one of many provisions in the law aiming to reign in spending.  

Before this provision, there was no disincentive to shoddy care that could land an elderly person back in the ER next week (beyond the hippocratic oath).  In fact, when the patient came back, they'd give them sloppy care and bill Medicare again, so having them back a week later would mean more money for the hospital.  

Example: I understand that doctors don't want to do time consuming procedures knowing that they won't be paid well by Medicare, but if the hospital they work for gets dinged when they don't, hopefully the decision to take shitty pay for an hour versus giving the patient a pill and rushing them out will be an easier one for the docs.

In a nutshell, Obama and Hillary and Clapper and Comey and Brennan and the 65 million + DNC memebers who are pushing The New Red Scare all handed Russia their greatest cold-war victory that they ever experienced... all because of the ""Pee-Pee"" dossier, because Podesta's Gmail account was hacked by the most basic internet phishing scam on earth... and the DNC and Intelligence apparatus that couldn't accept losing the presidency to Trump.

Spent an entire friday telling me this. promising me this.

Only to find out that he pleaded to talking to a Russian ambassador 2 months after the election about Obama's last minute tantrum sanctions that he placed as he walked out the door.

Another time was when they promised me just after the election that computer experts determined the voting machines in every state that voted for Obama and then for Trump were hacked!

A dude that didn't even work on the election or for the government.

I'm using this as a debate proposal and would like to see what con arguments (or extra pro research) people have to offer, so any contributions, positive or negative, are greatly appreciated.","There are a lot of reasons, but there are two main ones in my mind.

The first one is that liability doesn't cure patients who are treated incorrectly.  I recently saw a patient who had seen a NP at a walk in clinic for an irritated eye.  The NP wasn't able to find any foreign body or any other source of the inflammation so she referred the patient to an ophthalmologist and gave him some steroid eye drops in the interim.  Initially the patient's eye felt better due to the drops so they skipped the ophthalmologist appt.  About 1 week later the patient presented to the ED with a *severely* infected cornea.  As it turns out, the patient originally had a mild herpes simplex infection of his eye, but the immunosuppressing steroid drops let it run completely amok and he'll likely be virtually blind in that eye until he gets a corneal transplant.

The other reason that sticks out in my mind is a bit more biased, but I believe there is data to back it up.  At the moment, NPs and PAs tend to order quite a few more unnecessary tests than physicians.  With that in mind, it seems likely that, give the ability to prescribe medications, they will probably be much more likely to prescribe things like antibiotics, and more likely to use ""heavier hitting"" antibiotics.  Antibiotics are already overused, and this would exacerbate the problem.",7348,0,1,subreddit-moderatepolitics
"B: You can disagree with the Tea Party's politics all you want, but I don't understand why people consider them racist. Sure, there are racist elements among them, just like there are terrorists among Muslims. 

The Tea Party wants to drastically cut spending and lower taxes. For the most part, they want to either devolve or eliminate entitlement programs. But this isn't an effort to screw over black people. Its because they honestly believe that it is not the place of the government to do that, and they think spending is out of control.

Another I hear a lot, recently repeated by Morgan Freeman, is that they only oppose Obama because he is black. That is ludicrous, if you are a conservative/libertarian, then you are going to oppose Obama because you don't agree with his politics. If Bush was black, I would assume the Democrats would still have opposed his policies.

Can anyone explain, beyond the shock value of playing the race card, why do so many people try to label the Tea Party as racist?","People take a lot of little things that when separated aren't racist, but when together can seem that way.

B: Devil's Advocate - What groups attract more of a percentage of active terrorists?,"Red Herring.

Terrorism isn't really a religious issue, religion just happens to be the justification du jour.  The vast majority of people who actually commit terrorist acts (as opposed to people who use terrorist rhetoric) are poor people who lack realistic opportunities for meeting their basic needs, or who have been victimized by institutionalized violence.

Also, as I said elsewhere, what constitutes terrorism is incredibly controversial and it often depends on whose side you're on.

What's more, Islamic terrorism has it's roots in US CIA operations.  In the 1980's when the mujahideen were fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, the US funneled billions of dollars through Pakistan ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone)), and President Reagan called them ""freedom fighters"" ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen#US.2C_Pakistani_and_other_financing_and_support)).  Beginning with President Carter's national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski was explicitly aimed at increasing Islamic fanaticism in Central Asia to destabilize the Soviet Union.  Without the US' efforts, it's entirely possible that international Islamist terrorist groups would never have been able to form, because they grew out of US funded, US trained ""contra"" operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Simply put, Islamic terrorism was manufactured, and once begun, it became impossible to control.

So arguing that Islam produces terrorists is misguided because it ignores that Islamic Arab countries are disproportionately likely to be dealing with a military occupation, or dictatorship both of which are apt to produce terrorism.  Since the US, its interests and allies are the targets of much of those actions, it's easy for us to see it as ""terrorist"" instead of as ""freedom fighters"" like we did 30 years ago when the same sort of people were engaged in the same sort of behavior.  Many of the terror groups that so haunt the American psyche today were either explicitly created by the CIA in the 80's, or they grew out of the relationships and networks those operations forged.",1318,9,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics

Also, your entire position is based off of the notion that anti-discrimination laws benefit minorities.

I'd also rather not be hired as a token minority in a small business and find out 5 years later that there's no chance of me moving up in the business because the guy doesn't trust me based on my race.

Finally, anti-discrimination laws hurt businesses that cater especially to disadvantaged minorities. Say we live in a town where white people are generally wealthy and black people are generally poor. If I own a grocery store, I can discriminate against whites -- allowing me to offer lower prices without it affecting availability. I can move equilibrium to cater to the poor.

This is not okay either. You're trying to make a case that racism can be *good???*  Seriously, now it sounds like you really *do* condone discrimination.  If you think that sometimes having higher prices for some races is a *good* thing, in ANY context, then yes, you're definitely a racist.

You're kidding yourself if you think a law against spitting means much at all unless someone is caught in the act.

Note here that you've completely ignored my points that actually matter (racist speech, for example). I seriously doubt you support banning every single thing that could possibly hurt another person that you don't personally approve of. Please quit nitpicking the examples, and try to address the point behind them.

&gt;You're trying to make a case that racism can be good???

I'm trying to make the case that *discrimination* can be good. We discriminate all the time based on intelligence, income, age, sex, etc. but that does not mean we harbor hatred for people of these different groups.

&gt; If you think that sometimes having higher prices for some races is a good thing

Of course it can be. If shutting out 5 rich white people from your store means that a low income immigrant can afford to buy more food for his three kids, that can (from an overall social welfare standpoint) be considered a good thing.

Your entire response shows that you don't even know what racism is. From wikipedia: Racism is the belief that there are inherent differences in people's traits and capacities that are entirely due to their race, however defined, and that, as a consequence, racial discrimination is justified.

Nowhere am I saying that there are inherent differences in races that justify discrimination. Allowing people a right to use their property as they wish has absolutely zippo to do with ""inherent differences in races that justify discrimination"". Furthermore, the few situations that I believe do justify discrimination are those that have nothing to do with inherent differences and everything to do with circumstance and helping disadvantaged groups. Honestly, in a more technical world it wouldn't be justified at all (for example, the grocer could require customers bring in income statements and then only allow low income shoppers -- allowing the same effect but better focused and without ignoring outliers), but there are simply cases where racial discrimination would be a better fit due to lack of data (would exclude unemployed, homeless), time constraints (does the grocer have time to check every customer's income in a way that would not allow for easy fraud?), and cultural concerns (people might be embarrassed to shop at the ""poor store"").

&gt;During the several investigations, the California Attorney General's Office offered O’Keefe immunity from prosecution in exchange for providing the raw videotapes related to ACORN offices in California. The AG's Report was released on April 1, 2010: it found the videos from ACORN offices in Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Bernardino to have been ""severely edited""; it found there was no evidence of criminal conduct on the part of ACORN employees, nor of any evidence that any employee intended to to aid or abet criminal conduct. It found that three employees had tried to deflect the couple's plans, told them ACORN could not offer them help on the grounds they wanted, and otherwise dealt with them appropriately. Such context was not reflected in O'Keefe's edited tapes. The AG's Report noted that, because the Giles-O'Keefe criminal plans were a ruse, the ACORN workers could not be complicit in them. It found no evidence of intent by the employees to aid the couple.

They had a full investigation into it, yet you still hold onto the fact that they did something wrong?  I find it odd that you choose to believe the guy who made a name for himself by fabricating scandals, with an *admitted* bias, over official police investigation findings.  

Later, when you inevitably try to convince me that democrats are evil and tea partiers are all the messiahs, I'm going to think back and say ""this is the guy who picks information that sides with his world view, ignoring the information that's actually been vetted by independent investigators.""","The reason I still think that the video is important is because a lot of the damning parts of the video still stood even when the full thing was played out.

2. There is a relatively large proportion of genuine racists who support the tea party.  Obama IS black.  If you hate blacks on principle you will probably hate Obama for that reason.

I think the tea party would still exist.  There were inklings of it in the 2008 election with Ron Paul's campaign and a developing internet presence among conservatives.  The tp would probably be smaller though since Obama's identity of a 'black, elitist Chicago politician' strikes a more clear cultural contrast than Clinton or Edwards.  The ""corrupt chicagoan"" and ""elitist who tells you what to do"" imagery helps drive home their points about the authoritarian and corrupt nature of big government.  I think the tea party would be more libertarian and have less culture-war rhetoric.  There would be fewer racists and they wouldn't get called racist as often.  I doubt that people would call the tea party misogynist for opposing a woman president since Palin and Bachmann have so much support.

I think the race card primarily comes from people who either can not or will not acknowledge the appeal of the underlying arguments of the tea party.  They want to defend the president and policies that they support and, consequently, the only explanation for the tea party's success that they can come up with is ""they must be racist"".

At the same time you use these trained and accountable military forces to stabilize the countries that they thrive in. They always thrive in a failed unstable state like Libya or Syria or with the blessing of brutal dicatatorships.

You also use these trained and accountable forces to help create a democratic government by ensuring free and fair elections, rebuild infrastructure, and support and defend that democracy until it can raise it's own army and police force.

You can then have your foreign trained and accountable military forces stand down as the local trained and accountable military forces stand up. As those failed states become democracies, there are fewer and fewer safehavens for the terrorist to hide in, train in and recruit from.

Until there are none.

It takes some time, and you are right it is not easy. But the end result is democracy in the place of totalitarian dictatorships and hope for the locals rather than no alternative but to obey the people beheading everyone in the town square. And it is the only path there.

When we bomb the place from orbit, or hand out weapons to untrained and unaccountable civilian militas - and then brag about how much money we saved by not restoring order in the country... we end up with ISIS setting up shop in Syria, branching out to Libya... and no democracy or stability in either state is anywhere on the horizon. Not after 6 years... When really, they should be finally coming around the corner and voting and have their own democracy and military and police forces in training by now.

This is true but inauguration day isn’t the time to make that argument. It’s too late to do anything about it and it’s just sour grapes. The folks that protested in 2000, 2004, and 2016 weren’t protesting in 2008 so it’s clearly not about the system. It’s about the results.

And when you can’t even accept election results it’s hard to be civil when actual stuff is being discussed.",2013,11,1,subreddit-moderatepolitics
"B: What I'm saying, and what you are missing, is that the intentions of the protesters are not necessarily what you assume (if I read correctly, that is, as an attack or rejection of democracy). I would argue they were more motivated in response to a repugnance of Trump's personal and public actions.

If you recall, those protests were largely organized by women's rights groups, and this was hot on the heels of Trump's ""grab them by the pussy"" remarks, not to mention the loss of the Democratic appointment of the Supreme Court (which always raises the possibility of perhaps reversing Roe vs Wade), and the overall way in which Trump conducted his campaign (among other things, appearing at times to encourage the use of violence against political opponents, protesters, the press, etc). There were plenty of reasons to protest *Trump*. 

&gt;The folks that protested in 2000, 2004, and 2016 weren’t protesting in 2008 so it’s clearly not about the system. It’s about the results.

It could also be, you know, about the lack of congruence between the popular vote and the election results, perceived by many to be unfair. There was *a lot* to protest Bush in his second term... after all this was the administration that faked its way into a way with Iraq.","Every election the losers have many things to complain about. If we didn’t we wouldn’t have elections we would just appoint someone because we all agree.

But in America we have decided to hold elections to see who will represent us as president. Before 2000 we were mostly civil and accepted the outcome no matter how distasteful. The election decided who would lead. It’s what we had decided as a civil society to do.

In 2000, many Democrats decided they didn’t like losing and protested the decision that our society had come up with. In 2004 and in 2016 they decided to protest it again. And in 2004 Bush won the popular vote so it clearly wasn’t about the popular vote discrepancy.

They did not protest the 2008 and 2012 inaugurations so it’s hard to justify that it had anything to do with the process. They were fine with the process when their guy won. 

If we can’t even be civil on a day that used to just be a ceremony celebrating our proud history of peaceful transfers of power then how can we be civil about anything in politics. Inaugurations should be the least controversial part of politics. The part where decisions are already made and can’t be changed and new actions aren’t being made yet so we can rest and pick up the fight on Monday.",2013,13,1,subreddit-moderatepolitics

&gt;	I don’t see why citizens communicating their concerns / displeasure with their elected representative is some how a bad or uncivil thing. 

That’s what an election is for. Even our most popular presidents had 1/3 of the population oppose them. Elections make it quite clear there are concerns/displeasure. The point is take a day or two off. You lost. Accept it because you like democracy. Protesting an election is protesting democracy and protesting that others have different opinions than you and yours is more important.","&gt; In 2000, many Democrats decided they didn’t like losing and protested the decision that our society had come up with. 

Ah, so it was Democrats who committed the original sin? Of course it was. And naturally, that justifies everything republicans have done since then, right? 

&gt; They did not protest the 2008 and 2012 inaugurations so it’s hard to justify that it had anything to do with the process.

&gt; She hasn't made hundreds of millions off Wall Street. Her charity has made maybe that much but she's prevented from using that money for personal gain.

Remember... I'm just explaining how they feel about. You can argue the details all day, but from their perspective what they believe is she's a crook.

She definitely made a lot personally. I think their networth is 400m, a little under half of which came from speaking fees for she and Bill and many of which were from special interests like wall street and other large multinationals (much of which happened while she was actively involved with politics - That's the big issue here).  We have to separate the different types of crook we have. Trump came right around a time when people were really really wanting an outsider, money in politics was to blame for a lot of problems, and so on... They can see Trump's shadiness but it's not directly tied to politics. 

They can look at Trump and his shadiness and think, ""Well yeah... He's a businessman. Sometimes you are going to step on toes. But ultimately he just ripped off some other rich dudes."" That's how they view it... But then they see Clinton, and they think ""Oh she took money straight from big corporations for 'speaking' fees while in office. She didn't just rip off some corporations, but she's doing it at the expense of the USA as a whole!"" This is the big issue with Clinton. The perceptions is that she just ripped off the American people. That she's a crook willing to sell out the country. Perception-wise, Trump doesn't have that with his supporters. He's seen as a rich guy who doesn't need money any more and maybe ripped off some other elite rich dudese in the past. But ultimately loves America.

&gt; The idea that Trump is just an abrasive NYC talking playboy. He bragged about sexual assault, he has had settlement after settlement for accusations of racism in his businesses and sexual harassment

This is one where I even fall flat on, and kind of side with their perception on. The dude talked about being rich and powerful and how women like rich famous dudes, so much so that you can practically walk up and grab their pussy. I don't think most people are going to act shocked if a famous rich dude openly admits what we all know ""Women like famous powerful rich men"". So again, that's going to fall flat for them.

Same with the Muslim thing. Conservatives reject the idea of multiculturalism. It's not that they are racist (even though the left tries to wedge them into being labeled that.) they just like their culture, way of life, and so on, and don't want to be bothered changing the way they live and have lived, for some outsiders. Muslim immigrants are pretty much the anti-thesis for conservatives. Islam is dangerous, sexist, and has a pretty violent recent history. So to conservatives, it's not so much that they are racist against brown people, just that they don't want that culture in America. 

&gt; No, it's him installing people who do not believe in the job they have so that he can parcel out regulatory capture to rich buddies, like with the EPA for example, and dismantling the CFB.

Again, from their perspective it's just your words. How do you know they are trying to engage in regulatory capture? Yeah, he's tearing down some institutions from within. He LITERALLY campaigned on doing that. Going in and shuffling up government to more align with your political philosophy (small government conservatism) is not fascism. 

&gt; They didn't threaten the press for criticizing him

I think this is the left's own doing for being really intellectually dishonest through the campaign. While I think 90% of what's reported is legit, much of it is partisan spin, and it's allowed for him to create a fake news narrative. But everyone of his supporters knows this. It's his politicking of defending himself from a press, which, is really really aggressive with him. But again, would classify it as facist. I'd put it into that category when it moves beyond rhetoric and into actually jailing and punishing the press... Which he has no intention in doing. He loves the press in secret because he knows how to play them like an instrument and spread his message.","&gt;Remember... I'm just explaining how they feel about. 

I agree. What they feel about it is only sustained in willing ignorance of the facts, and a cultivated distrust in experts.
&gt;This is one where I even fall flat on, and kind of side with their perception on.

I don't know how I can say this without being abrasive, but your response is basically excuses and downplays. Here:
&gt;Same with the Muslim thing. [...] So to conservatives, it's not so much that they are racist against brown people, just that they don't want that culture in America.

So why were the Phillipines not on the ban list?  Literally where most Muslims in the world live. Why is Saudi Arabia not on the list for that matter? Even if they were, how does that make them not racist? ""It's not that they're bigoted against another group, it's that they want to make it legal to discriminate against that other group"" is playing fast and loose with *words*. I don't really *care* that my grandfather doesn't like black people, I care that he *discriminates* against them, that he takes actions against them on the basis of their race. That's what *counts*. This is leaving out Trump's actual history of racial discrimination, not just against Mulsims.
&gt; How do you know they are trying to engage in regulatory capture?

Beacuse they're not [trying](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/2/22/17036114/pollution-fines-trump-pruitt-epa).

&gt;I think this is the left's own doing for being really intellectually dishonest through the campaign.

Sure, fine, *whatever*, it *doesn't actually matter*. The left and right wings of our press corps have been precisely as low-content and sorry as they are now for about 12 years. Under both regimes of party, no one acted like *every historical dictator* towards them. You don't need to tell me why Trump doesn't like the press in general. No politician should ever like the press in general, *if the press is doing their job*. If a politician is doing their job in a non-fascist state, they are dealing with it in all kinds of ways that don't involve saying and doing precisely the things that dictators, and *only* dictators, say and do to the free press in their countries.",2013,74,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics
C: nan,A frequent criticism of gun control movements is a lack of well informed policy proposals. This article goes over a few policies that have been shown to work in practice.,8798,0,0,subreddit-moderatepolitics
"A: Could you elaborate on why you'd like to avoid a registry?

Also, I agree wholeheartedly with the tax deduction idea. As a gun owner myself, it amazes me that people own guns but don't own a gun safe. The idea of spending hundreds and often thousands on something that is dangerous and frequently stolen, and then putting in your closet, seems irresponsible and shortsighted. 

But the cats already out of the bag, and don't think we should ask people to spend hundreds of dollars without offering some assistance. They have been giving out trigger locks for years, so maybe there is funding available for a safe assistance program as well. ","&gt;Could you elaborate on why you'd like to avoid a registry?

A few issues.  We currently have 300+ million firearms in circulation and due the participation rate of state registries (4% in New York with their AWB) we can assume that most of the firearms will not be registered, especially those owned by less than savory individuals.  This will really impact the usefulness of the registry as a law enforcement tool and it would be made up of mostly newly sold firearms.  As firearms last for decades if not centuries with adequate maintenance we would have these unregistered guns pop up for years.  Even Australia who is seen as a gun control poster child only took in about 40% of the weapons they were targeting with their buy back and ban.  Guns are still found today and a recent amnesty lead to even more weapons being turned in after all of these years.

So we know that it will have limited value as a law enforcement tool, what will be the cost?  Canada has dabbled with a registry and projected it to cost only a few million with most costs being covered by licensing fees (something that has constitutional implications), yet costs ballooned and the few million dollar price tag ended up being a billion dollars and lead to the eventual end of their long gun registry.  A system that works and is large enough to meet the needs of the US and its diverse network of states might need to be even more robust and could have significant costs.  You would not be able to charge the amounts or charge annually like we do to support our car registry/DMV systems meaning that tax payers would have to pay for the bulk of this system and its maintenance.

Lastly, the future implications.  Our current system of FFL transfers for new gun purchases was a compromise.  The allowance of private sales was intentional in order to protect gun owners and prevent a registry.  The ability to have private sales dilutes the FFL records and prevents the government from being able to tie individual to a specific firearm.  While this limits the usefulness of trying to trace a firearm, something police still do, it does allow a citizen to some protection from confiscation.  The government would have to violate 4th amendment rights and would literally have to go door to door to successfully confiscate weapons.  With a registry, the government would know where each gun is supposed to be and could simply send a letter to the owner informing them to destroy, turn in to authorities, or face legal consequences.  This is something that Norway is doing right now to gun owners that legally bought and own Mini-14 rifles.  New York, Connecticut, and Hawaii have also all had their own dealings with confiscations or potential confiscations.  Denver has also put in law creating a bump stock ban with mandatory confiscation (no one turned in their bump stock).  Bans with confiscation becomes increasingly more likely if the government has the tools to specifically identify owners and can collect if necessary.  The lack of a registry is one of the reasons that grandfathering current owners is often the choice because of the inability to enforce a confiscation.

At the end of the day, registries equal confiscations.  We have examples in the US, around the world, current and historical.  This is a very dangerous tool to give the government, certainly when we have seen state governments already attempt to use them to do exactly what people have warned they would, confiscate.
