It is very important to realize that the FBI considers section 705 of the Patriot Act to be more important than the 4th Amendment: in fact, the FBI director said himself that phone snooping was lawful under the Patriot Act. \n\n4. The issue of FISA. There was a lot talked about FISA, but I can't ignore the fact that FISA has almost never denied a single query request made by the NSA. I think FISA sets some nice standards, and the NSA and the FBI were very clear saying that they needed explicit court orders from them to pursue any kind of higher level electronic surveillance on an individual, but they were not very clear on how to get that court order in the first place. The claim is that they have to prove reasonable suspicion to get the court order and **this was not elaborated on whatsoever in the testimony, only stating that FISA had a set of standards they give to the NSA.** I want to know what these standards are. \n\n5. My main problem arises with their statements that Snowden's revelations hurt national security. I see literally no reason as to why the information they disclosed to the public had to be classified.

In 1979, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the warrantless use of pen registers, attachments on the phone lines of individuals to record the numbers of outgoing and incoming calls. A year earlier, the court upheld the right of postal inspectors to review the addresses on the outside of envelopes without a warrant. Now, neither of these things is comparable to the massive collection of metadata from telecom companies today, but intelligence officials see it as essentially collecting information on the outside of envelopes, not the information inside.\n\n&gt;To look inside the envelope, officials point out, they have to go back to the FISA court. If, for example, the NSA were to see that there are many different phones calling U.S. numbers from a single location in Yemen, suggesting that there is an attempt at deception, the government would have to go back to the FISA court and present that information as justification for pulling up the content of those calls.\n\n&gt;My main problem arises with their statements that Snowden's revelations hurt national security.

Keep in mind we are at war still for the time being, and there are governments, and other organizations out there that, if given the chance, would nuke us back to last century.  \n\nLets take WWII for example.

Any foreign adversaries might be convinced that they are more concerned with spying on US citizens, rather than them. It's ironic the unintentional damage control the American public has done for the country.  \n\nLets entertain that there may be operatives within our borders planning the next 9-11. Say the agencies are mapping out their network of phone calls/conversations, and are really only concerned about that, not joe six pack. Now any foreign operative within our borders knows that they indeed have their number and change their methods to circumvent these type of things.  \n\nGiven these assumptions, it wouldn't seem too far off to say that what he did hurt national security.

Either way, it's not on a \"higher level\" than any other political side; it's just one opinion in an ocean of opinions. The opinion that, say, immigration is necessary for humanitarian reasons but needs to be controlled for economic reasons has just as much potential to be right or wrong as the polarised opinions, that on the one hand immigration should be actively encouraged, that on the other hand immigration is the scourge of the USA. Similarly, going by the other definition of centrism, believing that both left- and right-wing opinions are genuine isn't some enlightened perspective; it's an opinion on the same level as the opinion that, say, all conservatives are either brainwashed or corrupt rich people. How do we know that that's *not* the case? We don't, we just happen to believe that there are plenty of reasonable conservatives, and that's what makes us moderates. But it's with that same thought process that you get other opinions; some strong liberals just happen to believe that all conservatives are dumb and/or evil, and that's what makes them strong liberals. The gist of this argument is that there's a danger of seeing the left and the right as squabbling masses, with the moderates rising up as saints in the middle, when really we're all just having the opinions that we have.\n\nWith all that being said, what the hell is \"Humility is the fundamental virtue\" about? I think it's absolutely true that humility is the fundamental virtue, but what kind of message do you think it sends that a moderate is trying to tie it into the definition of his/her own ideology? This is on the same level as liberals saying that only the left-wing is altruistic and considerate, or conservatives saying that only the right-wing truly loves their country. Who are we to lecture others on humility, which has so little to do with our political ideology? Even if you could somehow prove that moderates tend to be more humble, it's just not helpful. It's patronising, it's alienating, and it just pisses off the people we're trying to reach out to. \"What is centrism? Ooh, centrism is what people believe when they are intelligent, moral, humble and can see the big picture.\" People don't respond to that with, \"ooh, I think I'm those things, tell me more!\", they respond to that with, \"Fuck off.\"\n\nSo as u/Spaceman31415 asks the very important question of how we get the rest of the world on board with being moderate, I think it's worth addressing the image we give off to the rest of the world. People don't get converted by being told they're worse than others, and centrism falls too readily into the trap of saying, \"I don't think I'm better than you, and because I don't think I'm better than you, that makes me better than you\".\n\nBy the way, I only picked out that particular section because that's the bit relevant to what I was talking about.

Moderation is about being open minded. Being willing to consider that you may or may not be wrong about a certain topic. That you might not know everything.  \nA moderate could have extreme right/left wing views. They could see the other side as \"evil\" or \"greedy\".  \nWhat differentiates them from the non moderates is their willingness to change their mind when they're presented with new information.  \nIn that sense the centrist you described could be considered a non moderate.

I'll use \"moderate\" the way you define it, and reserve \"centrism\" for the ideology.\n\nWell, it's interesting that you specifically say, they could see the other side as \"evil\" or \"greedy\". Is that really at all compatible with moderation? If you see the other side that way, it doesn't seem possible that you'd then be moderate enough to change your mind when presented with new information. If you are, then I wouldn't say you ever truly thought of the other side as \"evil\" or \"greedy\".\n\nAnd actually, I still stand by my point about moderation as opposed to centrism. The idea that it's better to be open minded and accepting is itself a pitfall. Yes, we believe that it's better to be moderate and open-minded, and that's what makes us moderates. What I'm saying is that there's a danger of our faith in moderation turning into pretentiousness, when we start acting like our open-mindedness makes us inherently better people.\n\nOr put it this way. Liberals presumably hate it when conservatives act like they have a headstart in an argument because they're more logical and intelligent. Conservatives hate it when liberals act like they're more moral and thoughtful. I just feel like there's a big danger of the same happening to moderates; that both liberals and conservatives get put off by moderates, because we appear on our high horses and act like our open-mindedness is automatically a point in our favour.\n\nAnd the reason I brought all this up in the first place, is because I feel like this article either reaches or is approaching that danger zone. It's easy for us to read \"humility is the fundamental virtue\" and be like, \"yep, totes agree, moderates ftw\", but that's because we're moderates.

I don't know how you link the estate tax to rising costs in education. With that logic, EVERYTHING should become more expensive, but the reality is, the number of people who are actually paying estate tax in proportion to the number of people demanding services like education is very, very small. They will not drive up costs for those types of services.\n\nThere has always been a healthy fear among those who support the estate tax that increasing concentrations of wealth would create dynastic-like conditions for a select few families, who could then use their wealth to gain increasing control over the government. It is very important for the wealthy to realize that there must be enough opportunities (or at least the perception there are) for the poor to get ahead.

Businesses (if you're talking about corporations) have an unlimited life and distributions upon liquidation are taxed.\n\nYour argument that education would become more expensive is incorrect. I don't know how you link the estate tax to rising costs in education. With that logic, EVERYTHING should become more expensive, but the reality is, the number of people who are actually paying estate tax in proportion to the number of people demanding services like education is very, very small. They will not drive up costs for those types of services.\n\nThere has always been a healthy fear among those who support the estate tax that increasing concentrations of wealth would create dynastic-like conditions for a select few families, who could then use their wealth to gain increasing control over the government. It is very important for the wealthy to realize that there must be enough opportunities (or at least the perception there are) for the poor to get ahead. Recent uprisings in the Middle East highlight this observation. When people feel the system is genuinely stacked against them, they start to protest. The rich can only insulate themselves from this chaos for so long."}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "&gt; Always remember the goal of estate tax is to wrest control of wealth from the few so that it can be re-distributed to the rest. \n\nUnfortunately, this is a terrible place to base your assumptions from.
