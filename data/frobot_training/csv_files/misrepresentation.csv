"A: I'm not surprised in the least that MAGA-ites would turn to the use of force to get their point across. Just like Jimmy Kimmel recently said, conservatives are all prone to violence.","Hey, just for the record, Jimmy Kimmel never said that. He did imply that Charlie Kirk's assassin in particular was ""one of them"" (meaning ""someone sympathetic to the MAGA cause"") but he never made this blanket statement.",100,0,True,['misrepresentation']
"A: I mean I really don't think progressives can be accused of racial discrimination!","(pass)",101,0,False,['misrepresentation']
"B: Agreed, but ditto conservatives.","(pass)",101,1,False,['misrepresentation']
"A: Are you *kidding*? They are constantly demeaning to blacks, if not outright insulting. Or have you forgotten when Charlie Kirk said ""black women do not have the brain processing power to be taken seriously""?","Wait a minute, A: Charlie Kirk never said that. Fact-checkers very convincingly found that he was mis-quoted in this case, and his remarks were taken out of context in a way that made him look racist.",101,2,True,['misrepresentation']
"A: Looking forward to next year's midterms. Hopefully we can boot out at least a couple of the squad.","(pass)",102,0,False,['misrepresentation']
"B: Agreed! AOC has got to go.","(pass)",102,1,False,['misrepresentation']
"C: The one I hate is Omar. ""Somalians first"": can you believe it?? How about America first!","Wait a minute, C; Ilhan Omar never actually said that. It was widely looked into and debunked. What she really said, under a fair translation, is something like ""We are people who know they are Somali and Muslim"". It was her political enemies who deliberately mistranslated and misrepresented her statement.",102,2,True,['misrepresentation']
"A: the economy is all going to s**t. Unemployment starting to rise, inflation going up, etc. Now Trump is going to find out how much people care about kitchen sink issues. It's like when Clinton said ""it's the economy, stupid!"" Or when Obama said ""if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.""","Actually, Obama was misquoted there. The Romney TV ad quoted him as saying he'd lose if he kept talking about the economy, but Obama was actually *quoting somebody else's email*, not presenting that as his own idea. Out of context, anyone?",103,0,True,['misrepresentation']
"A: Wow, another ship blown up off the coast of Venezuela.","(pass)",104,0,False,['misrepresentation']
"B: It's getting pretty wild out there. Are we cozying up to a war?","(pass)",104,1,False,['misrepresentation']
"C: I personally don't think so. I think it's just Trump's way of drawing attention to anything *but* the Epstein files.","(pass)",104,2,False,['misrepresentation']
"D: Are you kidding? I mean, he did demand that Maduro resign, just sayin'.","'fraid not. Fact-checkers have looked into this and confirmed that while Trump has definitely criticized the Venezuelan election, and also poured hate on Maduro, he is not on record as having called him to resign.",104,3,True,['misrepresentation']
"A: So SICK of people ignoring the debt!! Do we not see what's going on here, people? We're headed for bankruptcy!","(pass)",105,0,False,['misrepresentation']
"B: I know, right? And we've got Congress just putting fingers in their ears. All they care about is getting elected.","(pass)",105,1,False,['misrepresentation']
"C: Yep. Like when Eliz Warren said ""there's nothing in the constitution that says ordinary Americans have a right to see what we're spending on."" Gee, thanks Senator!","Sorry, but that widely-quoted statement is just flat false. Elizabeth Warren never said it, and there is no reliable origin for it on record.",105,2,True,['misrepresentation']
"A: Does anybody seriously doubt that Trump would resort to the use of force if necessary to stay in office?","(pass)",106,0,False,['misrepresentation']
"B: Oh, c'mon, that's overstating the case. Sure, he has bullying rhetoric sometimes, but I can't believe he'd actually deploy troops or w/e.","(pass)",106,1,False,['misrepresentation']
"C: Get a clue, B! Have you forgotten Jan 6 when he said ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol and fight like hell???""","Actually, C, this was a misrepresentation of what Trump actually said that day. It was BBC's Panorama program that spliced together parts of his speech to make it sound like those two halves of your quote were a single statement, but he actually did not say those words in that sequence.",106,2,True,['misrepresentation']
"A: Starmer needs to be booted out. I know he's trying to stand up for true Brits and all that, but he crossed the line when he said - as PM, if you can believe it - you guys treat Muslims better than your own citizens.","Actually, A, that is a widely-spread misquote. For one thing, the incident in question occurred before he was Prime Minister, not after. For another, it contained added commentary that framed his remarks falsely.",107,0,True,['misrepresentation']
"A: Farage is dangerous, I'm telling you. Just consider: he missed the UK state opening of parliament to be with Trump in the US instead!! :-O Wow, what priorities!","That's misleading, A. Reuters checked pictures and records and affirmed that he did attend the UK opening ceremony (though he did miss the later debate).",108,0,True,['misrepresentation']
"A: Conservative media is out of control. It's a cesspool of an ecosystem, peddling in misinformation. I mean, remember the brilliant Tucker Carlson suggesting that Ukrainian deaths were staged to blame Russia? LOL! Conspiracy theories galore.","Actually, fact-checkers have thoroughly debunked this quote, A. Carlson did not in fact make this claim in this way, though he may have hinted at it more obliquely.",109,0,True,['misrepresentation']
"A: Look, liberals: if you don't like the USA, leave! Nobody's stopping you.","(pass)",110,0,False,['misrepresentation']
"B: Uh, like that's an option.","(pass)",110,1,False,['misrepresentation']
"A: Actually, I believe it is.","(pass)",110,2,False,['misrepresentation']
"B: Lol, right. What, like, when Rick Perry said Texas should secede from the union?","Sorry, but I just have to chime in here about Perry. The record clearly shows that although he may have entertained the question of secession under extreme conditions, he made very clear that he did *not* advocate dissolving the union. His remarks were mischaracterized.",110,3,True,['misrepresentation']
