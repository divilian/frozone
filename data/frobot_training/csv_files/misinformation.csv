"Hart-Cellar has destroyed America's major cities, and is on the verge of destroying America generally. When you include illegal immigration, it's even worse: there are probably 100 million foreigners within our borders","Those numbers aren’t accurate. The Hart-Cellar act changed immigration but it didn't destroy cities, and there are no where near 100 million undocumented immigrants in America.  Actually, estimates in reccent years put it closer to 11-14 million.

These are images Americans should have never gotten used to... Twenty million illegal migrant invaders from 183 countries poured into the United States during the previous administration. It will take many years to deal with this crisis.,"I see the images are concerning to you, but the numbers are off.  There aren't 20M illegal immigrants in the US in total, let alone that many entering the country within 4 years.  Take a look here, there are tons of statistics on this: https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/",1,0,TRUE,['misinformation']
Illegal migrants are receiving $3500 free cellphones and free housing meanwhile victims of hurricane Helene only got $750,"Hey I did some digging and it turns out that illegal immigrants aren't getting those things especially not $3500.  That claim is reffering to a pilot program in NYC to make food distrubution easier for those in need.  It's only provides food and baby supplies for one month, plus the actual number is closer to $350.  I found this fact checking article that really explains it well https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/11/facebook-posts/no-migrants-dont-receive-3500-debit-cards/",2,0,TRUE,['misinformation']
"Hillary Clinton supports unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding.",That's a bit misleading.  Clinton clearly supports a womans right to choose an abortion and she's called for ending congressional restrictions on Medicaid funding of abortions. However she's said since 2000 that she'd support a legislated late-term limit on abortion if it included an exception to protect the health of the woman (which the law against partial-birth abortions does not). She hasn't pitched for unlimited abortion on demand.,3,0,TRUE,['misinformation']

A1 Shredding released a statement about them being at a Cobb County election processing center. The fact that the nobody has been arrested for shredding ballots is mind blowing. The Democrats stole the election right out in the open. The DOJ is a disgrace! Fire AG Barr!,"The claim that ballots were being shredded in Cobb County was investigated.  It turns out there were documents shredded but they weren't ballots, just waste materials that routinely get shredded.  Here's some reporting on it https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-9761550584",6,0,TRUE,['misinformation']

It's an open secret in the medical community that sids is literally just the mother wigging out and having a 4th trimester abortion.,"That's hurtful to families who have experienced this.  SIDS is a real and tragic medical condition, not an abortion.  It has nothing to do with the parent's mental state.  Here's some more info if you're interested https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/13646-sudden-infant-death-syndrome-sids",8,0,TRUE,['misinformation']
Remember when we were told for decades that the Maldives would soon be under water because of Climate Change? Guess what…  Nothings changed because the Climate Change Hoax is a Climate Change Scam.,"I see where you're coming from.  Some predictions have turned out not to pass.  But the Maldives are facing real consequences like severe erosion, saltwater intrusion contaminating the freshwater, and damage to coral reefs due to climate change.  Wikipedia has a page on climate change in the Maldives that's no nonsense.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_the_Maldives.",9,0,TRUE,['misinformation']
"WHO created Climate Change Hoax to implement UN Agenda 2030 worldwide. They constantly use the Problem-Reaction-Solution tactic to create fear, then play off that fear to move their agenda forward. It's manipulation. There is no Climate Crisis. Science does not support their claim.","Hey, that sounds pretty scary, but climate change is supported by decades of research and data. Agenda?2030 is a sustainable development plan, not a plot for control.
