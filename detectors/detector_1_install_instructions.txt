Set Up For Detector_1

Setting Up Python 3.13.7 VENV
1)
Follow instructions on https://aruljohn.com/blog/install-python/ to install python3.13.7 on Linux and Mac distributions. If you are on windows you can look at https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#windows-full.

2)
If you set 3.13.7 to be your default then saying python --version or python3 --version should return Python 3.13.7. If not run the command python3.13 --version to make sure you get Python 3.13.7.

3)
Use "python3.13 -m venv <dirname>" to create a new virtual environment.

4)
Use "source <path/to/venv>/bin/activate" to activate your virtual environment.
# SD->GM: I believe this needs "/bin/activate" here (I added it)

5)
When done use "deactivate" to terminate the environment.

Getting llama
1) 
Go to https://ollama.com/download and follow the instructions there.
# SD->GM: does this install in a certain place? how will pip find it? Or is
this step incompatible with step 2), below?

2)
pip install ollama

3)
run the command ollama pull gemma3

Setting Up The .env File (There are spooky API keys in here so don't edit the file)
1)
Move it into the directory where you have detector.py and detector_1.py
# SD->GM: and when you say "it" here, what exactly do you mean? Is there a
# file we need to download from somewhere, and then rename?

2)
Make sure it is literally named .env

Pip Installing All Requirements
1)
Get the requirements.txt file from GitHub or your local repo

2) ## We are having some issues with our req.txt files. At the moment there are
two. For this detector make sure to pip install the requirements.txt in the detectors directory ##
Run the command pip install -r requirements.txt
Note that you may need to specifically say python3.13 -m pip install -r requirments.txt
